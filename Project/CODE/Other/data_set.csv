However, at ANY price, the product was worthless.  The adapter size was OK and the cord was long enough... BUT the connector end was wrong.  The shape was correct, but the size of the connector was much too small and would not fit the GPS device it was intended for, even though the Amazon description was very specific that this adapter was correct for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 it was bought for.  Since the cost was nearly nil (other than a couple of bucks for shipping), I did not pursue replacement.  I am still without an AC charger.",1

I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge; it also takes this long to charge the device.

9984984362,Generic Standard Red LED Wall/ AC/ Home Charger for Garmin Nuvi 1490T,A1LKXQNNHK1NMO,Not a Bad Little Charger,This unit works as advertised.  Not the best charger I have ever used but not the worst.  It allows me to keep my Garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip.  (Could be real useful if you use your GPS city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot.)  All in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other GPS accessories.,3

The charger does what it says it does, and charges the GPS just fine. The only problem I have isn't really with the charger, but with the GPS. When the charging through the USB port like this charger does. The GPS stays powered on in ""USB Connected Mode"" the whole time. You can't turn it off, and so the screen, back-light, and maybe the GPS antenna are running while charging. Thus, increasing the time needed to charge.",3

998498480X,Garmin Nuvi 855 Standard Red LED Wall / AC / Home Charger,A3R2M5ABAYL63P,I bought one of these? Where did it go?,I used it once. Worked jus' real good.Can't find it now - it's probably with the 87 other AC adaptors I have because the idiots in the electronics industries can't agree on one or two standard charger voltages and connector shapes... grrrr....,5
998498480X,Garmin Nuvi 855 Standard Red LED Wall / AC / Home Charger,A3RYHP2OYFJ3YC,Device can be used while plugged into charger!,"The thing I liked best about this charger is that one can actually use the GPS while it is being charged.  As you probably know, when the Garmin is plugged into ones laptop via USB, it enters charge-only mode and you cannot use the device while it's being charged that way.  This unit enables one to charge the device in a hotel room without the need for a laptop and allows use in order to find an expensive Italian restaurant nearby.By the way, though the title says the LED is red, mine was actually blue (Horrors!)  That slight misrepresentation aside, I think this unit is well worth the investment.",5
998498480X,Garmin Nuvi 855 Standard Red LED Wall / AC / Home Charger,A261321MIS0YPB,A/C charger for your Garmin?,"I really don't have one of these wall chargers.  I did buy the accessory kit for the Garmin 260W, and use the USB cable attached to my desk top to charge my Nuvi - for what it's worth.  Also, I might mention that the Sandisk 2GB SD card I bought for my 260w may not serve to increase ""memory"" for GPS Garmin Nuvi functions.  The SD card will hold photos and recall them to display on the Nuvi, but I don't know that it will service ""routine"" GPS functions.  If anyone has, knows, or gets information about this, I would like to hear about it.I conveyed this info so that people won't buy stuff that they really don't need, and expect it to do what it won't do.",4

9985511476,Professional Kingston MicroSDHC 4GB Card for Garmin nuvi 1450,AK2XW27R76ZTC,It works.,"I bought two of these for use with two Garmin nuvi 1450  units. In my opinion, it is unfortunate that the Garmin nuvi 1450 requires extra storage capacity to handle updates; I think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the United States and Canada. I don't know yet whether I am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and I don't know whether a bigger card is available.",4

I had a 2GB Micro SD card installed in the Nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update, but it would never complete the download.  On an off chance I ordered this Micro SD and it worked perfectly the first time.  I have no idea why the old card would not work, but now it doesn't matter.

B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,A1CZ8JTF1JCI72,Good tapes,I`m a musician and I record almost everyday . These tapes is an excelent way to check my self. Very clean recordings and excelent playback.Good tapes,5
B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,A1PC3H8P4MZ3BV,May not work well with high-end decks,"Like another reviewer here, I can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism. On my Nakamichi BX-300, they frequently stop during recording or playback. It's a tension problem, wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage; basically, it thinks the tape is stuck. Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes. I've had no problem with other, commercially available cassettes on this deck.My advice, if you have these tapes, is to run them a bit before you record to them. Pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape, then rewind fully. Maybe a few times. With one tape, after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side, until I performed the above. YMMV. Recorded audio sounds fine.I would add that these are recommended in the Nakamichi owner's manual. Go figure.",2
B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,AT8TIN5JKHO2V,"There is ""Maxell"" and there are the rest!","As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60's and 70's.I have used thousands of Maxell cassette tapes over the years and the quality has been superlative.The Maxell XL2 is high bias, also known as chrome, position 2, and CRo2.  They are specifically engineered for music.  If you are recording rock, jazz, or classical the quality will surpass your expectations.Maxell's reputation for tapes was solidified as far back as the 1970's when the majority of the sound crews would use Maxell at the mixing board for playback after a live performance.In order to get the best result it is imperative the tape deck you use has clean heads all the time.  Failure to keep dirt away from the internal parts will result in sub-par recordings even with first class tapes.If you are recording voice only, look for the normal bias, position 1 tapes by Maxell.Try to avoid using tapes over 100 minutes you will have less headaches with breakage.  The 110 and 120 minutes are thinner and will tear fairly often.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent""",5
B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,A3OBZ4F27KV8NO,Hard to find nowadays,For some reason couldn't find high bias cassette tapes around town. Amazon to the rescue. No problems or complaints with this product.,5

B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,A3UNITKTFPNT9W,"high bias tapes, who's got some more?","let's just get past all the bs, okay? they--as in maxell--should still be selling these. I record on them all the time and it's just so fng ridiculous that they could be discontinued, or be sold for fifty dollars. It's true, that no tape really sounds better than these, unless they were to start releasing metal tapes again, which is impossible in this market.I record lps onto these tapes, and listen to them in the car. It took me a long time to get the peaks right for recording, as in where I should average the peak decibels to record at. I eventually came to five plus, which means the bars never go above four decibels. I believe my peak levels are in line with the balance of sound, that while the directional booklet for my cassette player (a tck670 sony three-head) says record at plus three, letting it go a little bit above that but average at +3, means you're getting as much sound  without breaking your eardrums. They also say to record two decibels below the distortion point, and for me that's like 7+ on a lot of stuff[some records are louder or softer than others when it comes to decibels. For instance Prince sign O' the Times is very loud, and I record at around five+ or below, while the smiths queen is dead, the newly remastered version, is softer, and I record at a 7 recording level. Recording level is how much sound is filtered through the cassette player onto the recording medium, while the decibel count meter shows you how--scientifically that is--loud what you are recording really is].Now I'm not gonna' say it's always pretty, sometimes there's an album like let it bleed, where the lp was put together rather shoddily, and the acoustic tracks are subzero to the rockier tracks. In such cases I've tried to record each track at the peak individually, though I haven't really heard them enough yet to know if this works. I will say that listening to these on a car stereo, well, the car stereo is a lot more sensitive than floor-standers and a good sony receiver. You have to be accurate to get the best sounding tape, but the reward can be fantastic.You see, I used to listen to cds, like all through college, but then my ears started to turn negative to the extreme highs and mids. Plus, you never understand the music in your brain from a cd like you do on an lp. Basically I cannot barely stand to listen to digital unless I have extremely good speakers, and that's not often.So lps it is for me, but I wanted to hear them in my car, so began this whole trek to get the tapes to sound right. High bias is much more difficult to get right than normal bias, which if you listen through a good stereo, reveals all the definition of a rough sketch on paper. The high bias is pretty accurate, though someday I would wish to maybe improve the class of cassette player I have and see if I can't do even better? Oh well, right now I have a system and it works pretty well.And to think they're not putting cassette players into new cars anymore! I rather think the record industry would not be suffering now as it is, if it had kept true to fidelity and analogue, and most importantly vinyl, which cannot hardly be digitally downloaded without gutting the sound and a lot of work! It's what they get for years of $20 for new cds and the nightmare of sam goody. They wanted to profit by everyone buying their collections all over again, and look where it has got them! People listen to music--if at all--as a casual thing, where they never really listen and wouldn't spend a dime for the crap they do in fact hear. The labels killed their own business by choosing the cd over the lp.But at least I can find used lps for bargain prices now, eh?Or prohibitively expensive boxsets. ):",4
B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,"Very durable, long lasting, with clear sound","I have found, through my experience, that Maxell XLII high bias cassette tapes are highly durable, long lasting, and play back very clear sound.  While high bias tapes are not the absolute best for recording from CDs (metal bias tapes are), they are a big step up from normal bias tapes.  I have used these Maxell tapes for about 15 years for everything from voice recordings, to sound effects, to music.  About 10 years ago I started getting into CD burning for some of my music needs, including burning my own original music from tapes onto CD through the computer, but I still use these Maxell tapes to this day for certain things.Cassette tapes and tape decks are becoming more and more a thing of the past.  If you still have use for them, then I highly recommend these Maxell tapes.",5
B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,AD3EX5UG7UZPB,Exploitative pricing,"EDIT: Turns out there are a few companies out there that still make high end cassette tapes for recording. See the link from the commenter below, and also try musicians friend. Don't buy this aged overstock overpriced junk!We who still love the warm sound that only analog provides and are still die hard, DIY recorders using analog 4tracks are forced to pay ridiculous prices for OLD overstock hi-bias tapes from the 90s since the only brand name cassettes you can buy at a store like Walgreens is a 5 pack cheapo Maxell normal bias (even these are being hard to come by). This is the case with Amazon and eBay - all I can find are overpriced overstock still sealed high bias cassettes for five bucks each plus shipping - Neither TDK nor Maxell make Hi-Bias anymore so all we have is old leftover stock and these sellers exploit that fact. I'm not sure if the cassettes lose any of their quality after a certain amount of time (please comment if someone knows), but regardless, I don't recall paying these prices when they were new!I don't know if anyone manufactures new Hi-Bias tapes... if anyone knows, please comment... Anyway, this is very discouraging. A home made tape was a labor of love and a sound you cannot get from digital. I still am a die hard analog DIY recorder, and I use an 8 channel analog Tascam 4track, one of the best models of 4 tracks made, using Shure studio mics, and I often master to a CD burner, not a PC (depending on what I'm working with). The tracks only become mp3s when I rip the master CD into the computer. It has become increasingly harder to do this because of this. Now I use my 4track mostly to record solo recordings but I have used it to record full band demos and have been able to produce near professional quality recordings! Sublime's ""Robbin' in the Hood"" was recorded entirely on an analog 4track, as have others.Doubtful, but any sellers reading this? Your 10-15 year old overstock hi-bias tapes aren't gold, jerks.",1
B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,A2R6RA8FRBS608,fine high bias 90 minute cassette tape--with just a slight drawback or two,"Maxell manufactures excellent ""Xlii high bias"" 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. Record lectures, music, conversations, piano playing and more--whatever you want! The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.The tapes are extremely well made in that they DO allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.If you pay the current Amazon price of $13.77 for the five-pack you spend roughly $2.75 per tape. Some people will find that to be too expensive while others will want these blank cassette tapes anyway, not minding having to pay the price.Unfortunately, these tapes still cannot produce 100% the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be at least somewhat sharper and clearer with less background noise than these Maxell cassette tapes will give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording. I also agree with the gentleman who suggests that you clean the heads of the tape deck before using these cassette tapes to maximize the quality of the recording.Overall, Maxell Xlii high bias cassette tapes makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.",4
B000001OL6,Xlii 90 High Bias Audio Cassette Tape -5-Pack,A4JHEO7H330AF,These tapes have been my friend from 1980 to 2009.,"I have used Maxell XLII for over two decades.  I've used them on a Nakamichi 581 cassette deck, a Tandberg TCD320 cassette deck, and small hand-held recorders from Sony (with built-in microphone).I've used the Maxell XLII tapes for recording albums from vinyl, recording from compact discs, and recording live, e.g., parties, waterfalls, and my own electric-guitar playing using a Nakamichi microphone.When I first got my Nakamichi 581, I did a side-by-side test of an actual vinyl record, and my taped copy of the vinyl recording.  I was not able to tell the difference.  This demonstrates the high quality of the Maxell XLII tape.  The particular recording was a duet with Max Roach on drums and Anthony Braxton on saxophone.  This recording was an especial challenge to the tape's ability to record at higher frequencies.  The Maxell tape passed the test, so to speak.  Also, I recently listened to recordings that I made in the year 1980.  I have no reason to believe that the recordings on my Maxell tape have deteriorated.  This is another good thing about the Maxell XLII tape.I have nothing bad to say about the 90 minute Maxell XLII tape.But I do have bad things to say about tape recorders.  First of all, my Tandberg is a risky machine.  Perhaps, one time out of 100 times that I use the Tandberg, the tape gets tangled up.  I blame this on the Tandberg, not on the tape.  Another problem is that my Nakamichi 581 has been broken for many years, and I have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine.  The Nakamichi 581 was, and probably still is, the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind.  But I can't find anybody who can fix mine.  Again, this is not the fault of the tape.Finally, Sony had an excellent little hand-held cassette player/recorder, the TCM-454VK.  The sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and children's music concerts.  However, I dropped this Sony machine, and it broke, and it is not manufactured anymore.  Instead, Sony does make a similar, newer model, but the sound quality of this Sony cassette recorder is garbage (please see my reviews of the newer Sony machine).  But this is not the fault of the tape. Sony TCM-200DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder adds a high-pitched whining sound to your tapes.  A similar recorder, the Panasonic RQ-L31 Portable Cassette Recorder with Slide Microphone, adds a high-pitched chirping sound to your tapes.The following applies only to recording nature sounds, children's marching bands, and so on.  The following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discs.Last year, I bought a digital voice recorder, the Olympus DS-40.  Please see my review of the Olympus DS-40.  The Olympus DS-40 is an absolute dream and a miracle  -- because of the very low background noise, because of the absence of clicking sounds when starting/stopping or when pausing/restarting recordings, because of the extreme length of recordability, and because of its extremely compact size.  Therefore, at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds, marching bands, and parties, cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice.",5

The heads look well made (I've seen others that were downright crude) and the mechanism is quiet after six months' use.  Sound quality is certainly good enough, although my car is noisy enough that it's not a big issue.

In my Rav4, cassettes load by inserting the narrow end. But since I didn't hear any audio, I thought this adaptor was broken. It turned out that if I made the audio cable exit on the *other* narrow end of the cassette, then there was no problem.Also try increasing the output volume of your iPod.TESTED WITH :------------A 2001 RAV4 and an iPod 30 gig and also an iPod Touch.

The sound isn't quite CD quality but it's pretty darn good and definitely better than a regular tape. I don't have an FM adapter but from what I read, the cassette adapters have a much better sound.The other big bonus is that it doesn't matter which way the larger opening is on your tape deck because this adapter has a latch you can open on the bottom to change the cord over to the other side if needed. Warning, some brand name adapters will only work in tape players facing a certain direction! Every once in a while I have to put the tape in twice for it to work right; otherwise I haven't had any other problems with this and it gives my mp3 player a great sound! Another tip: if you don't have an equalizer on your car stereo or mp3 player, what you can do is adjust the volume on the player and your stereo to balance the bass and treble (for me, if I have the mp3 player sound lower and the car stereo louder, I'll have more treble...and a little more static, too).As an aside, I doubt the product itself was the problem for the person with the bad car speakers who reviewed this product negatively.",4

Probably the largest factor is going to be the quality of the cassette deck that will be using the device, specifically, the playback heads.  The results weren't quite as impressive in one of my in-home cassette decks, though still good.Another very important factor is the quality of the MP3's being played; the better the playback device, the more readily you'll hear the shortcomings of a MP3 or other digital file.  After all, some people are happy with 128 kbps MP3's (which are pretty low quality to begin with) and none of my MP3's are less than 256 kbps ... even those I've purchased from Amazon.Overall, I'm very happy with this device and consider it a very good, inexpensive alternative to having a dedicated LINE IN/LINE OUT option like those you find on newer in-car decks.

Never cleaned the lens the entire time I own it.  Lately it's been scratching my CDs, and frequently not playing them.Put this lens cleaner in.

After a couple times of putting the CD back in I heard instruction in track 1 saying that tract 2 only needs to be played the minimum of 20 seconds to get the lense cleaned.My player required 5 playings of full tract 2 to function properly again.When I took the lens cleaner out, I see a lot of dust on the little brush, and on the bottom surface of the disk (picked up by static?).

Almost every time I put a CD in, the player would spit it back out and the display would say ""CHECK CD."" After 3 or 4 tries, the player would finally accept the CD. But it sure was frustrating. So I stopped at the dealership and inquired about this problem. The first thing the service advisor suggested was to try a CD lens cleaner. I had never used one of these in my life. And I've had CD players since 1984. But when I went to my brother-in-law's house for Thanksgiving, he had just purchased this same identical CD lens cleaner at the local Meijer store. I asked him if I could try it out in my car's CD player and he gladly obliged. Well, after one cleaning, so far the CD player hasn't rejected any of my CDs. And we drove back home after Thanksgiving...almost 300 miles...and played many CDs. So, for now at least, I'm convinced. I came right home and ordered this Maxell CD lens cleaner for myself. I don't know if I'd feel comfortable enough to try it in my Mac desktop or PowerBook...but I think I'd feel safe using it in my Sony CD player or PlayStation. In fact, the PS2 will be the first device to get cleaned when this arrives. It's been rejecting discs, too. Maybe the lens is just gunked up with dust. Anyways...it fixed my car CD player trouble and saved me a lot of money that the dealership would've charged me to service the darn thing. I'd recommend it highly.",5

Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music.  Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs.

These things don't do much; you stick it in, listen to some jingoism and a pleasing voice on the first track, then advance to the cleaning track and wait for 20 seconds while a continuous beep ensures you turn the volume way down. Afterward, your lens is clean. That's all there is to it.Why does the lens have to be cleaned? I can't answer that since I've never seen one. In the cassette era, I bought a clumsy plug-in electrical wand with a metal probe that I had to physically touch to my recording and playback heads (on reel-to-reel players too) to demagnitize them. Apparently all that tape going through left some kind of magnetic charge behind that would foul the signal at some point. It's questionable whether the gadget I owned ever actually worked, unlike this product, which works every time.There's no such issue with the digital CD lens cleaner. This disk has some encoded voice commands and about a dozen little brushes the protrude about 1/8 of an inch from the surface of the disk. I guess the disk spins and the brushes rub off the bad stuff from the CD lens. If there's another explanation, I'd like to hear it. It works every time.Unfortunately, the thing this product won't do is eliminate age from cranky car CD players. I've owned a couple GM models where the player had to be replaced and the player in my 2006 Chevy Malibu is becoming increasingly wearisome. It has a habit of failing to play disks that are thicker than the norm. You'd think there would be a standard in the digital industry but there is not. Sometime spinning my maxell CD-340 arrests this behavior but typically it does not. I usually have to burn myself a homemade disk on a maxell CD-R blank disk Maxell 32x CD-R For Music - 30 Spindle to get the recalcitrant player to spin the music.As for the cleaner, it works in spades every time.

It then plays a little music and talks to you! When it's done cleaning your CD player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels.

Nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or more.These headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package. Commuters, some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these. They fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you. The headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it in.The earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear. (I've been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort.)If you don't demand much in the way of bass or treble, the audio range is acceptable. As I said, these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said, distortion isn't a problem even with the audio cranked up.These headphones don't pretend to be noise-cancelling. They are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor.

Mind you, I'm certainly no audiophile and I abhor ""bass"" in my music and whatnot, so take that into consideration. For basic computer usage and pop music, these sound perfectly fine.Comfort: Actually, these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. I get headaches if I wear a pair of headphones for too long, due to the pressure on my head. I also can't wear headbands for the same reason. These headphones are so lightweight and flexible that I can barely tell I'm wearing them - and so far, no headaches, even though I've worn them for some longer periods than I normally wear headphones.Overall, I'd say I'm surprisingly impressed with these headphones. I got them expecting the usual cheap headphones I buy (the brand changes, since I just buy the cheapest 'phones I can find by a brand I've actually heard of) and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones.

The Maxell 19 10 18 offers the quicker approach (It will not give you the results of the more time consuming).  The labor intensified cleaning means taking the door off the deck (For the units that allow this) and cleaning the pinch rollers and heads with specifically designed swabs and fluid.If you want faster results, Maxell has done almost all the work for us.  The cleaner looks like a standard cassette.  The instructions will specify the amount of liquid to add to the cleaning tape and the length of time to play in the deck.  Presto that is it!As always, try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.  Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent""",3

The old one was eating tapes, received a ""new"" one from a friend.  Didn't chew up tapes, but it only showed a quick 2 seconds of a tape, then everything was garbled beyond recognition.  No matter how much I played with the tracking, it did not improve.  Ran the Maxell VCR cleaner through a few times, seemed like a slight improvement.  Ignored the direction and instead of putting the fluid through the hole, applied generous amounts directly on the tape ribbon.  Put it back in the VCR, ran it a few more times, BINGO, works again.I read other reviews saying this was not the original Maxell VCR cleaner.  It seems like it is to me, but bottom line, I could care less, it worked.  I will say this though, if you want to convert precious home movies to DVD/digital from VHS, don't use an old VCR.  This improved the VCR by magnitudes, but in my opinion, it's not going to be as good as new VCR's that are made specifically for converting and compensating bad track.

The old model seemed overpriced, but it was hand-made in a low volume production. Current models made by new owners are priced about 170% more than the old, for which you get a fancy box and a few instructions on a CD rather than on a peice of paper - big deal. However, the new models have a lens mounting arrangement which is much superior to the prior model and much more expensive to make. As to function, nothing really replaces an Expodisc if you need one for white balancing a color photo exposure. I use mine to shoot ""grey"" color negatives to automate traditional color printing. I have no experience as to whether they provide superior white balancing in digital systems as claimed, but logically they should do so. Unless you plan to be very exacting about color reproduction in your color printing, the excessive cost of an Expodisc versus the marginal benefit seems questionable. If you Photoshop your pictures to death, you will get no value from this item.",5

That's right...  my first Sony ICF-S79V lasted almost seven years which is why I had no problem replacing it with the same model.  The reason why I had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time.  The second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid / wet conditons.  I would totally recommend this product because it looks great, last a long time, gets great reception, a huge amount of digital presets and much more!",5
B00000DM9W,Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer),A3JVD6IJPRCXT1,I like this radio,"I looked at several brands of AM FM TV Weather radios for use during severe weather when power might be out. I was searching for specific features:1. Battery power (for power outages)2. TV band (tornado tracking is sophisticated enough to get down to street-level tracking on TV. NWS hasn't caught up yet)3. Decent sound qualityThis radio met all my needs with the added bonus of being water-resistant. (I must admit I am baffled by the term as EVERYTHING is water-resistant to one degree or another.)Reception is good in all areas of my home (including those areas where we cower when tornados are lurking). The radio includes a wire antenna for FM reception which stows in the battery compartment.Sony recommends leaving the three ""C"" cells in the radio and changing them every year. This maintains the time and radio presets.Pros:  Good reception, solid design, handy controls, good sound.Cons:  Bigger than some.To avoid finding the radio with dead batteries (or worse, corrosion in the battery compartment), I set reminders in my Palm to change various batteries annually.",4

The digital tuning is essential - you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station.  I love the presets, and listening to 60 Minutes and similar TV shows is great.  The solid base means it's less likely to fall over, or off of things.  The radio is pretty tough - I've dropped it and had nothing happen, but once the AM antenna broke and that was that for talk radio.  And the batteries really do seem to last forever!  On the one I have now (five years old), the plastic waterproof top is cracking, and the FM antenna caught on something and pulled loose.  So, I'm buying another.

Speaking of AM, this has absolutely the best AM reception of any radio I've had.One last comment: the batteries last quite a while.

I guess she must have liked it a lot too. After about a week without it I had to buy another.  I do not use it in the shower but I do keep it in the bathroom on top of the toilet tank.  Wow is it great.  One push on top and the radio is on. You don't even need to have your glasses on because the button is big.  Push another button and you set a timer for it to go off after 15 or 30 minutes so you don't have to remember to go back in and turn it off. I'm listening to the morning news while I brush my teeth and dry my hair and put makeup on, and I can put it on a classical music station for a soak in the tub after work.  It's not too big, the controls are simple and intuitive, and it looks nice. The battery lasted in the first one for the whole year before my sister took it - it's probably still running at her house on the same battery.

B00000DM9W,Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer),ABVYGB2TKBO8F,Great radio - fills the promise,"I purchased this radio from Amazon in May of 2003. It's now January 2005 and the radio is still on the first set of batteries. I use it at least a 1/2 hour a day and on weekends as much as 3-4 hours per day. Fantastic. It shows no sign of wear even though it has spent hundreds of hours in the shower, and has even been in light rain beside our spa.It gets great reception (no TV signals in our town), is easy to use, and sounds great.I highly recommend this radio.UPDATE Oct 28, 2010After 7 1/2 years of daily use my Sony shower radio finally quit. As many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked, water got into the Off button area and the radio would no longer work. However I just ordered another one.This radio has some very good qualities.Pros:1) Clear and loud sound2) Battery life is so long it is ridiculous. I don't think I used more than three sets of batteries in 7 years, and I use the radio every day.3) Good reception.4) Ease of use. I really appreciate an AM/FM radio with station presets.5) It is waterproof enough that I take it in the shower every day. I don't leave it there though because I use it on the bathroom counter while I shave too. Perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it isn't in the damp shower area 24/7.6) I like the top buttons. They are easy to hit with one hand. If the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands. My radio is never mounted high so I don't have the issue others complain about where they can't see the buttons. Even if I did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bump.Cons:1) $49 is a very high price to pay for an AM/FM radio.2) It does seem Sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longer.I was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale. I looked at a few others but nothing matched, in my opinion, this one.",5

Peace of mind with water resistance, I've not placed it in the shower but do have it in the bathroom which often gets quite steamy.5. Excellent sound for the type of radio it is, clear and loud.6. Small footprint takes up little space.7. Like the wire antenna, didn't think I would at first. It is better than a hard antenna sticking up waiting to be bumped and/or broken.8. Timer and auto-off timer are quite nice also, even though I sometimes forget to use the auto-off timer.9. Digital tuning and display makes it simple to find the station you are looking for.10.

This radio also has very good reception, bringing in one of the weaker stations I like loud and clear.My one complaint is that it has two very little rubber pads on the bottom.  That means the designers thought of slide resistance (like when the radio sits on something made of porcelan) but they didn't do enough to prevent it.

B00000DM9W,Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer),A1JFXOFDRZ9CFQ,A FABULOUS RADIO,"When home, I have the radio on a lot of the day, mainly talk radio.  I bought 2 of this radio in August 2000 (yes, three zeros) and they bit the dust in late 2007.  I got about 7 years of EXCELLENT performance from these radios.  I have 2 because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back & forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed.  The other goes between kitchen and office constantly.  There's 5 presets for AM.  I wish there were more.  There's 10 presets for FM.  One used to be for Howard until he left (a huge Howard fan here who has not gone Sirius) and now I basically only use one for WCBS-FM (when they got smart and realized, in the immortal words of NY Daily News, that they didn't know jack), and the others go unused.  The TV channel part of this radio, I never use and couldn't comment.The radio is excellent.  The controls are responsive, the battery life is very decent, and most importantly, the reception is excellent.The reason my radios now need to be replaced (I just ordered one from Amazon and will try the Sangean for the second) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic.  After 7 years of pressing the on/off button I'm sure thousands of times, the plastic over the on/off button ate through.  The on/off button needs that plastic over it to work!!  The damn thing won't turn on/off now!!  I tried turning the volume down to zero to ""turn it off"" but the batteries do wear out and it's annoying.So I figure that 7 years of constant usage is pretty good and I am not complaining and have even come back for more!In spite of the 7-year life, I still give this radio the highest rating.  Fair is fair, right?  Can't complain about 7 years of perfect performance, can we?  I say no.",5

I honestly didn't expect it to be, especially with a single speaker.Everything else works as advertised.  I can get TV/AM/FM/Weather stations well.  The old Curtis shower radio I had was very spotty.  Digital tuning is awesome.  The old one was analog and a real pain to lock on to stations that had a great signal.

I've had mine about six months.  It's got everything a radio should have and nothing it doesn't need, except maybe the digital clock.  The knob on the right top is volume.  The rest of the controls are push buttons on the top that include five presets for each of three bands.  The buttons are under a protective rubber cover so no need to worry about humidity or splashes.  It has an 18"" antenna with a little suction cup at the end so you can hook it on a mirror.  And it has a loop of twine on the back for carrying it around or for hanging it on a coat hook or something similar.I find its clunkiness sort of endearing.

Great fit and finish.2. Not too big. Seems smaller out of the box than photos on Internet suggest. This is good for cluttered showers.3. Easy-to-use controls for clock, tuning and presets. I didn't even need to consult the manual.4. Excellent sensitivity for AM (internal ferrite antenna) and FM (a pull-out wire from the battery compartment).5. Full sound to overcome shower noise.6. Sony's decision to require 3 C batteries insures long-lasting life between battery changes.So far I have not found any weaknesses with the radio. Sony has found a niche in their shower radio. I give it the fullest recommendation, especially for the 45-dollar price (and free shipping no less) I found on Amazon.",5
B00000DM9W,Sony ICF-S79V Weather Band Shower Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer),AHSBR2WTM4P1G,Nice radio,"Update: I've had the unit now for about two years. It still works fine, although the material covering the on/off button has worn completely off. Actually, it started wearing off after less than a year. In light of the fact that this is designed to be a ""shower radio,"" this is really an inexcusable flaw: after all, you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio. Fortunately, I never used the radio in the shower itself. But, still, I'd have to take at least one star, even two stars off, for this defect (which I know other reviewers have commented on as well).The radio was a little smaller than I expected, but that's good. It takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive. The reception is generally very good, although I tend to listen to only one station (89.3 KPCC). Still, I had trouble getting good reception with my last radio (an Aiwa), so the Sony is a big improvement. Occassionally, I still get a little static (depending on where I am standing in relation to the radio), but overall I would give it a score of 4.5/5.0 in terms of reception (I still occassionally get some static). I also tested all of the TV stations, and the Sony had no problem tuning them all in. No static to speak of, although the volume was low. I would definitely recommend this radio.The sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this. I have to crank it fairly high to hear when I'm taking a shower (even though it's waterproof, I don't put in the shower with me). However, there's not distortion at high volume.I cannot say anything about the battery life yet, but overall I'm very satisfied with the radio.",4

Radio still works (though lately I need to move it around a bit for best reception)and the clock is still really hard to see.  It is the volume button that is kaput. I can only get very loud and painfully loud.  Husband tried to fix it but couldn't do it.  Seven years is pretty good, I guess. I don't see anything better on Amazon, at least for this price, so I will probably purchase another of the same.  Something I did not mention in my original review:  the batteries seem to last forever.  Same number of stars for the same reasons.Original Review: This shower radio is attractive, compact and has great sound and station range. It is a 5 for the radio and a 1 for the clock. Unfortunately, the clock is very small and hard to read.  I purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink, but could not read the digital clock from there.  If the radio is placed too high or too low, the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame.  There is no back light which adds to the difficulty.  I had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where I stand and I still have to bend down slightly to check the time. If having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you, this Sony is for you.  If you really need a clock in the bathroom, this is not the one for you.",3

It's not stereo, and the speaker is not large enough to provide a wide frequency response. But for its size and shape, it's as loud and clear as it can possibly be.You will never find a better radio for use in the shower: the reception is outstanding. The speaker is clear and loud enough to hear in the shower. The case is attractive and tough. The controls are easy to operate, even with wet hands. How often do you buy a product that's reasonably affordable and absolutely flawless?Update 11/7/08: My wife still won't just leave this radio in the shower, to my occasional chagrin. She carries it around the house to listen to NPR while she works on stuff and I can never find it when I want it. Today she dropped it on our hardwood floor. The battery door popped off, and and the batteries spilled out. She put them back in and NPR was again heard from the radio. Why haven't you bought one of these yet?Update 8/31/2010: Still going strong. This radio is no longer available, but theICFS79Wseems to be an able replacement. What a workhorse this radio has been!",5
B00000DMA3,Sony MDR-NC20 Noise Canceling Headphones with Foldable Headband ,A3UFCX1AE4TKZE,"Good sound, Good Noise Cancelling, Good for airplanes.","I've been using these for over a year now.  Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well.  I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in.  I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.All in all, I'm pretty happy with these.  The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldn't justify the $300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups.",4
B00000DMA3,Sony MDR-NC20 Noise Canceling Headphones with Foldable Headband ,A33FS5H3CPDR6D,Best Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I will admit that I recently gave up my Sony Headphones for the Bang and Olufsen A8's ----- however, that was more for portabilities sake, than soundwith regards to sound, this is the BEST pair of headphones that I have usedThe noise cancelling features are excellent! -- putting these things on, along with the noise cancellers, allows you to hear sounds that you never knew existed within many of your favorite songsI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Bose Quiet Comfort 2, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of these and you'll fall in love quick!",5
B00000DMA3,Sony MDR-NC20 Noise Canceling Headphones with Foldable Headband ,A1Q5M90ZZEEAL1,Not what I'd hoped for.,"I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel.  They fall short for two reasons.  The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise.  If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.  The second problem is that they generate noise of their own.  If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz.  So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal.",3
B00000DMA3,Sony MDR-NC20 Noise Canceling Headphones with Foldable Headband ,A1N03V52IRZ5PR,"The ""Get Smart"" Cone of Silence has finally been perfected.","I've owned these for years. I used to fly two round trips a week, and I wore these constantly, whether or not there was any reason to (in flight entertainment, a CD player).The first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible. I could hear the person in the next seat better, and, in fact, I found that I could eavesdrop on people a row or two away, since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked, but the speech came through.The loud, constant background sound in airplanes is very draining. I was more likely to be able to nap with these on, and I was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noise.Don't get a unit that simply insulates the sound - you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds. There is nothing wrong with that solution, it is just that the solution of generated countersound (exactly out of phase, exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming), especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones - as far as I am concerned, nothing works as well.Microphones that are placed in an off-headphone device can't tell where the headphones are direction, or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones. This effect is not as important at low frequencies, but it becomes more important at higher frequencies, so this unit can provide more coverage. The design is simply the best possible - microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefit.Well, being in a quiet environment works better, but that is not always available.When you are flying, especially if you fly a lot, small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it. These cost me less than a quarter per flight, have lasted years and are still going strong.Sound quality was fine. I could head spoken voice programming just fine, and, far as I was concerned, music was enjoyable. Airline provided programming was much better than the provided headphones.",5

Even so, there is a lot of pressure.  After about an hour they start to hurt my ears.  I have tried to ""stretch"" them, but they always return to the same size.  I also put extra foam padding in the ear cups, which helped a little.They still have good sound quality, and cut noise- although they are not as effective as when I first bought them.I tried the new Bose.

The picture and sound quality on these tapes isn't quite as good as the more expensive 8 mm metal tapes, but it's decent enough to do an adequate job of capturing your moments.  I swear, the picture and sound quality on the 8 mm camcorders and 8 mm metal tapes is sometimes better than some of the top-of-the-line hard disk camcorders.  I have a hard disk camcorder, but sometimes I wish I had an 8 mm camcorder.I recommend these Maxell 8 mm tapes, but I would try to get the metal kind if you want REALLY good picture and sound quality.",4
B00000IGBF,PalmOne IIIx Handheld,AUCF61BNJ5ZX7,Useful device,"It works for me. That's all it has to do. It was and still is, an interesting idea who's time came and is still with us.",5
B00000IGBF,PalmOne IIIx Handheld,A15U38AWJ3JDN5,"Great product, but fragile","I've had my Palm IIIx for over a year now, but I'm going to have to get another, because I dropped it. The Palm didn't fall far -- 3 feet or so -- but it is now useless. White lines cover the display, and the digitizer no  longer works reliably. I have tried opening up the case and re-seating the  circuit boards, which fixed most of the problems, but the digitizer is  permanently inaccurate. Even with re-calibration of the digitizer using  preferences, the location the Palm thinks I'm hitting with the stylus is  wrong, and this makes using the Palm impossible.I bought the slimline  leather case, but this clearly failed to protect the Palm in any way. Also,  the velcro has now come unstuck, so my Palm won't stay in the case.This  is a real shame, as my Palm IIIx is indispensable. I bought Intellisync  software to syncrhonize it to the calendaring software I have on my PC, and  I use it every day to navigate my schedule. Combined with the address book  for names and phone numbers, I have one place to work out what I'm supposed  to be doing and whom I'm doing it with.I don't use the other  applications much. I tried out the e-mail application, but it is way too  simplistic. I get over 200 e-mails a day, and I really need e-mail folders  with automatic filtering to manage that kind of volume. I use Eudora, and  the Palm e-mail application doesn't support its folders or filtering. I  can't even convince it to just download the messages left in my  ""in"" box after all the others have been filtered out.Being  able to upgrade the operating system on the IIIx turned out to be  important. Version 3.3 of PalmOS supports infra-red sync with a laptop.  This is a godsend when I'm travelling, and for syncing during long  meetings. Being able to upgrade easily from PalmOS 3.1 made it  possible.I have also downloaded a few games to while away long plane  trips -- PocketChess is my favourite. Very easy to play -- just drag 'n'  drop the pieces.I have looked at the Handspring Visor as a replacement,  but lack of upgradeabile OS is a key sticking point. Handspring devices are  stuck at Palm OS 3.1, and Handspring's code seems to have diverged at this  point with no hope of picking up any changes post-version 3.1. Long term,  this could turn into a real problem assuming Palm continues to improve  PalmOS. The Springboard expansion slot is a great idea, but there are so  few expansion cards available that its utility is a joke. Color cases  looked cool -- until I saw them in real life vs. a photo on the web. They  look kinda cheap & nasty.So, I'll probably buy another Palm IIIx.  The IIIe isn't expandable, and I can't see how color is so useful that it  justifies the staggering price of the IIIc. The Palm V looks cool but I'm  even more worried about its fragility, and the Palm VII could be great if  it could actually surf the web, rather than use extraordinarily limited  ""web clippings"".",3

At the touch of a button, you can connect it to your PC and transfer all of its information (which also means you can input information to your palm  from your PC). There's a myriad of freeware available on the net that will  enhance the performance of the Palm IIIx. The screen is great for viewing.  4MB is more than you'll ever need (I have many programs loaded, and  thousands of phone numbers and appointments, and I only use 1.3 MB).The  great advantage of the Palm IIIx is that it uses batteries (versus the Palm  V and Vx, which are rechargeable), which means you don't have to carry your  cradle when you travel, and you can get batteries for it anywhere!

Boy, have I been converted!  The Palm IIIx (my second Palm - the first being a III) is, for  me, a great value.It has enough memory for anyone but the most  compulsive note-taking, yellow page totin' workaholic among us.  (I  download an average of 300 Palm formatted web pages a day and have had no  problem with space in memory at all.  I also keep about 700 phone listings  and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times)  It has the  improved screen and processor versus the III.  And it has the benefit of  the Palm community of software developers that is what sets Palm devices  apart from Windows CE (and other) devices.I like the fold-over cover  both for protection and for the Star Trek communicator look :) and feel.  The backlight takes a little getting used to.  It is not useful at all for  dim daylight use, but works just fine in dark situations.I really want  the Palm Vx for the sexy size and industrial feel, but I have no real  reason to move away from a device that does everything I need and more (and  costs a lot less).",4

I am more than satisfied with Palm products, and am currently looking into a Tungsten as an upgrade.  The Windows based palmtops are nice too, but they cannot beat the Palm's reliability and ease of use.  The software is also very stable and easy to use.  This is the only device of its kind I own that has never lost data or become corrupted.  Reliability goes a long way with me, so I give it 5 stars!",5
B00000IGBF,PalmOne IIIx Handheld,ARXU3FESTWMJJ,A great choice but not perfect,"The big questions these days is what organizer to get. I'll assume you are reading these reviews because you already know that the Palm OS beats CE any day. So the choice is a Palm Vx, a Palm V, a IIIx or a Visor. I can't recommend the Visor right now due to the horrible problems people are  having with Handspring...maybe in another year, but not now.The new Vx  is a good choice, lots of memory and the other advantages of the Palm V  like a better screen, and rechargeable battery. But the darn thing is still  overpriced. If money is no problem though, I'd probably go with the Vx.The V is good too, but only 2 meg of memory...yuck! Now, 2 meg of memory  is going to be enough for a lot of people. If all you want to do is the  basic appointment/phone book/to-do stuff, 2 meg is more than you'll ever  need. But that's it...you're stuck with 2 meg and can't upgrade (easily).  If you are interested in using your Palm to do internet stuff, grab  webpages with AvantGo, play games, read books, etc. you're going to find  yourself a bit squeezed by 2 meg. You can still do quite a bit, but it's a  bit more work to manage your space.Now, for less money you can get the  IIIx. You'll have twice as much memory, and the ability to upgrade. I  personally put on the TRG xtra xtra pro board which gave me 4 meg more of  RAM and 2 meg more Flash...it's like having an 11 meg Palm! Really great.  Of course, I bought this before the Palm Vx came out, today it's not quite  as good a deal to do.One other reason I like the Palm IIIx is that I  have a lot of add-ons that only work with it...the Palm Navigator  (compass), the Weatherguide, Landware's GoVox voice recorder, etc. I don't  believe these will fit a Palm V. Of course, it goes both ways....Palm's new  33.6 modem and the new wireless Omnisky modem only fit the Palm V.I do  believe the Palm V has a better screen, it doesn't seem to have the streaks  that a lot of the Palm IIIx's have. And there's no doubt it has a certain  ""coolness"" factor. Most of my friends at work went with the Palm  V. But they are fairly impressed with the space and the accessories I have  for my Palm IIIx.",4
B00000IGBF,PalmOne IIIx Handheld,A2CC2CRU24E44X,Good but BEWARE the streaks,"I have to say that I've grown very dependent on my IIIx.  I'd give it a score of 5 except for the streaking problem.  Mine didn't do this right away.  It started hapening about 6 months after I began to use it.  Sometimes its there sometimes it isn't.  When its there, the streaking  (looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing) can make the  screen totally unreadable.  Five minutes later, all can be fine.  PDA need  to be dependable.  Mine isn't always.  Before I started reading other  reviews, I thought mine was just broken.  I was considering buying another  but not if by luck, I get another ""streaker"".  Even though I like  the IIIx, its reasonably priced (though still expensive), has great  software options, I'd be cautious about buying another one.

I had this DVD player and a Proscan DVD/DIVX (which the salesman at [...] SWORE was the best that money could buy).  The RCA DVD just quit working entirely after 11 months (microprocesor).  My [$] Proscan DVD player now displays a ""NO DISC"" message seemingly at random, and for no particular reason.  Sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time, others you have to try it a few times, and on the worst days you may have to try 15-20 times and it still may not work.In both cases I called RCA, sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time, spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support, and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replace.RCA's warranty is useless, their technical support line is an exercise in futility, and I personally don't think it's worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products.

It's capable of producing flawless images and sounds--unless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive, which happens far too often with my temperamental (fastidious?) machine.  I would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions, as this model requires extra deep shelves.  Finally, its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with GE or other RCA monitors than with  Philips, Magnavox, or Sylvania monitors.  (It may be important to remember that  a VCR plus DVD assembly requires running the latter in ""auxilliary mode,"" which is hidden away somewhere in my set's menu choices and virtually inaccessible.)

B00000J05A,RCA RC5220P DVD Player,AHY2KG32696ES,good luck getting one that works perfectly,"I bought this player about a year and a half ago.  It worked great (for about 3 months).  It played all the DVDs and CDs.  Unfortunately, it cannot read VCDs or CD-R/RWs.  For most people that doesn't matter, I guess.  However, only after about 3 months of light usage, the player started to act-up.  Sometimes, it won't read the DVDs--the player indicated ""no disc"" in player.  I unplugged it and it worked after re-plugging it 1 minute later.  Then, it doesn't work again, and I repeated the same procedure of unplugging.  Finally, I sent the player back to RCA.  Since it was still under warranty, all I had to do was pay for shipping.  It came back after about a month.  It worked, and then I started to see the problem again within a couple of days. I was confused.  Why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work?  So, I tested it out to see the prob. myself.  It appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak, and being unable to read the disc, I thought, could be due to the fact that RCA had provided a weak motor part.  I was half right.  I removed the plug from the UPS/power supply and plugged it directly into the wall.  Ever since, the player was plugged directly into the wall, it shows no problem.  I think I may have found a solution (for now)--the difficulty in reading the disc, I concluded, was due to lack of power [believe it or not].  Well, if you have the same problem, try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player. It might work.Beside this, the machine is good.  It played every single DVDs I've ever rented or bought. I have this hooked up to my reciever through TosLink (optical cable).  The sound is excellent--good proportion of sound from center, satellite, rear and subwoofer.  It plays CD but it takes a second or 2 to skip to songs.  Basically, don't expect it to play it like a real cd player.  It sounded just as good though.  The picture quality is excellent.  Eventhough I don't have an HDTV, I could still clearly see the improvement over the VHS, or BETAMax tapes. I'm getting rid of it now because I want a new and better player that also plays VCDs.",2

To be fair, it once meant superior quality and cutting-edge innovation, but GE along with General Motors and a few other ""Super Conglomerates"", took a vacation from quality and innovation in the latter half of the last century. Now they're madly playing catch-up, and this little radio, even though it's a throwback, is the first sign I've seen that they're making progress.It's a simple am/fm radio.  It's a little too bulky, has very nice monoraural sound, and the knobs are a bit too small for arthritic fingers.  Still, it's just what I needed, and it's the first GE product I've intentionally purchased in over thirty years.  Either my standards are coming down, or they're actually improving their quality.",4

I figured with a smaller unit, I would save space and not have a very good sound. I was wrong about this unit. I was very pleased to listen to the quality of sound from this unit. 2 people that sit near me in my office have enjoyed this radio as well and have ordered one for themselves as well. I highly recommend this product. It is a good price, small, and has a great sound.",5
B00000J060,GE 72664 Portable AM FM Radio Black,A22Y586YTVSY10,Good little basic radio,I wanted a radio to listen to NPR for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo.  I did not want a CD or tape player.  This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it.,5
B00000J060,GE 72664 Portable AM FM Radio Black,A2V8VLTPY3W01E,great little radio!,"I bought this for listening to NPR while working on painting and  stenciling projects on our backporch.  I was pleasantly surprised to  discover that it does a good job with music as well as spoken words.  I  also like the fact that it has a solid, metal antenna instead of one of  those thin, whispy wire ones that so interest the feline members of our  household (my husband recently bought a clock radio with one of those  antennas -- after two days it was summarily detached and removed to the  living room for the 2000 Antenna Olympics).  Another nice feature is the  little compartment in back in which you can store the electrical cord.",5

B00000J060,GE 72664 Portable AM FM Radio Black,AC8E3L5ZM01P,Great sound for such an inexpensive radio,"I needed a cheap radio for background music.  All I wanted was  decent sound and to receive FM radio.  I wasn't interested in playing CDs or MP3s.  Since I do a lot of work around the homestead, I wanted it to be small and easily portable and still have decent sound.  This GE radio delivers on all counts.  I live rurally but still close enough to town that I can't comment on long-distance reception.  All I can say is that I get all the radio stations that I want to listen to, the quality of the speaker is plenty good enough for my taste and level of loudness in FM music, and I don't get any frequency drift so that I don't have to constantly fiddle with the tuning knob.  It's just a great little radio for a very decent price.  The only downside is that the FM antenna is quite flimsy and can be all-too-easily bent if you knock the radio over with the antenna extended.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A3NSPDT7PQAUA5,Good reception for weak AM stations,"I bought this radio in order to listen to an AM station in my area that is very weak.  Prior to getting this radio, I couldn't get it to come in on any radio in my house.  Now, I can get it very strong and clear.  The only complaint I have is that the dials on the front for volume, etc. don't seem well made and seems like they could break or come off.  Since I leave it on the same station and same volume all the time, it probably won't be a problem.  It also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels.  It's pretty lightweight plastic.  But, the only reason I got it was to receive this one station, and it does that job well.",4
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A29G75YOG3SOW2,A Good 5-Cent Cigar For Only 7 Cents,"Being one of those people that likes to chase late-night AM signals, I was convinced that this was a radio I had to have. I was a bit disappointed in some areas, but still see it as something good. This radio is big. Period. Once loaded with ""D"" batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a ""DX Machine"", both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.On the plus side:1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City. The wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds2) FM reception is quite good. Picking up low-power locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit. I didn't realize there were so many FM's around until I purchased this radio3) AC power cord. Fits neatly in the back of the radio (albeit a bit cramped), and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals.Although not quite as good as its predecessor the SuperRadioII, it does what it is designed to do - allow good reception of AM and FM without any bells or whistles to get in the way.If you can find it discounted, then pick one up and listen away. Otherwise, there are better choices to be found in this price range.",3
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,AZBELVP7XNQ2W,The best radio ever,"So great, I bought one for everyone in my family.  The ultimate Christmas present.  Great range, clear sound and when plugged in it charges the batteries.  Incredibly durable too.",5

Second model owned, had their original model for 13 yrs and was so impressed I got a new one.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A2T70SN2VZHOR4,The Standard,"Most radios you can buy have pretty cabinets, nice paint, and will sound pretty good if you're tuned to a station whose radio beams are about strong enough to cook an egg.  They're designed to impress you in the big box store, where looks and the sound of the most powerful station in town are all you have to go on.  It isn't until you get them home that you find out how miserable they are in real-world performance, trying to pick up that weak station that's the only one carrying the game you want to hear.The GE Superadio is a whole 'nother deal.It's just an AM-FM radio, aggressively avoiding any other features whatsoever.  But it's the gold standard of the type.  When a radio geek wants to say whether some other set is good on FM and, especially, AM, s/he will compare it to the Superadio.To give you an idea how good it is; I live in a semi-remote area without any really strong AM stations.  Sitting side by side on my couch, a typical 'personal stereo' type radio picks up one AM station.  A cheap transistor radio picks up three.  The Superadio picks up 37.I recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits.  For one thing, it will run about two hours less than forever on its six D-cells.  For another, this set can pull in AM stations at least two, three hundred miles away, in daylight, any time.  If your blackout extends farther than this radio's range, you've got more important things to worry about.Incidently, it runs off AC also.  It switches to AC automatically when you plug it in, switches back to batteries automatically if AC isn't available.Sound quality is excellent.  It's mono, but it has a good and large speaker and enough audio power to drive it properly.  It also has separate treble and bass controls.I give it four stars instead of five for three reasons:1.  Some of them don't work.  The first one I bought didn't.2.  Stations are hard for me to tune toward the upper end of the AM band.  They're packed very tightly together there, and getting from one to another nearby is fiddly.3.  The ""wide"" bandwidth is useless to me.  There is no radio signal in my area strong enough for it.  I have to use the narrow setting, intended for weak and distant stations, for everything.Still, it's a heck of a radio for remote areas, for camping trips, or if you want to know how well a radio can work if somebody at the company gives a darn.",4
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A2QAS68TU5KOZT,Everything you've heard is true.,"A friend of mine had this radio for listening to sports.  We live in a small town and have trouble receiving AM stations from the city on normal radios.  With the Superadio, there's no problem.  The tuner is sensitive and easy to use, the speaker sounds good, and the dials are tough.  I think this radio is a perfect part of anyone's emergency kit.  You'd be able to tune in stations from far away in the event of a power outage in your area.  So far I've used mostly the batteries for power and they're lasting nicely (the product instructions say they'll last for 460 hours of on time).  Do yourself a favor and buy this radio, it's a fun toy and a useful tool.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,AXCWZ8HUF332W,"Great AM reception, hard-to-believe worksmanship","I got this radio to pull in both remote stations, and to have better reception. I also wanted something battery-powered for emergency purposes in case of power failures/earthquakes, etc.First impression is that this is one big, ugly, heavy radio. That impression never goes away, because it is big, ugly, and heavy. The apparent workmanship, fit and finish, looks like it was put together in the dark,  by a developmentally-challeneged monkey, who had lost the instructions. It just looks, frankly, awful. Cheap plastic, poorly made (with all sorts of ""color swirls""), with chrome paint. About like the interior of a mid-70's Chevy.It uses no fewer than 6 ""D"" cells. But the radio is so big you hardly notice. Most of the size comes from the 6"" diameter of the speaker and the enclosure behind it. It probably to about half a barrel of oil to make all the plastic. There's also a very crude perforated metal grate over the speakers. All the knobs and switch *seem* like they will fall of at any moment, and the tuning dial and linear indicator are similarly questionable. It has a handle, and while you can carry it around, it's a ""portable"" radio in the same sense that the original ""beige toaster"" 128k Macintosh was portable.As far as entertainment products go, this radio is the opposite end of the spectrum from the iPod ""Nano"".You might think that you will get some pretty great sound from a 6"" ""woofer"" and a about a 3/4"" ""tweeter. But no - the sound quality, overall, it not very good at all. It always sounds ""tinny"" and while it's plenty good enough for AM voice it's really not much better on FM.But, by golly, it does have absolutely terrific AM reception. Right away, all the""problem"" stations I had before were perfectly clear. With a Terk loop antenna, I spent a few late nights trying to see how many of the 50kW ""clear channel"" stations I could get. With care in tuning the antenna and the radio, I got the Hartford, CT, station on the first try. Didn't last too long, but I got it. This from *Sunnyvale, California*. It's relatively easy to get stations in Wyoming and Nebraska on good nights. Seattle, LA, Salt Lake, no problem anytime, even with the internal antenna.The tuning indicator is nowhere close to accurate and in any case the markings are so crude that you can't reliably set the radio using the existing marks. I just put some paper correction tape on the scale and marked the frequencies with a pencil.One thing that I didn't see in the other reviews, or anywhere else except the instructions, is that the radio is capable of being set to use 20 kHz bandwidth instead of the usual 10, meaning you get a lot better sound than normal. The speakers stink, but the reception is better and the incoming information is less compressed. Of course you want narrow for long-distance listening but if you listen to nearby stations it helps quite a bit.The FM performance is nothing to write home about, hardly any different from any other radio you might buy. It has AFC to help control the drift, and it seems to work just fine. But it's a mono radio, and the speaker quality limits the sound quality. It's bad enough that it will wear you out if you listen to music for long. There are tone controls, but no amount of fiddling with the bass and treble will fix it. If you want a good-sounding FM Radio, get the Tivoli Model One. It's about 3x the price but the sound is about 10x better. It's clear to me that virtually all the price of the GE went into the AM receiver part, and the rest of it was compromised to meet the *very low* price.With the huge battery pack, I suspect it will run a very, very long time on one set. Of course, it can also use AC.Crudity aside, the radio works exactly as advertised, has brilliant AM reception, will probably run forever on a set of batteries, and is so inexpensive for the performance that you really can't go too wrong.p.s.  to clarify, my review is for the *GE* version, not the RCA version, which is still big, ugly, and poorly made - and also has terrible performance. The GE version works well, the RCA does not",4
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A384UZZIZDHSNJ,A bit  of history,"As someone who worked for the GE Audio division back when the first Superadio was developed, I can attest to the fact that the product was seriously designed as a very high quality piece.  The engineers had their GE radio reputations on the line, and the concept of good mono vs. bad stereo obviously had market appeal.Over the years, inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made (I was part of some of these types of discussions as well), but when I was looking for a good portable radio, this version was high on the list.  We have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound.  One problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out, but that's why we have Amazon, right?",4
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,AW8UBYMNJ894V,"Careful, it melts!",I bought the original version of this radio back in the late 70s. We've had this one for over two years.  It's a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shop/work use.  We left it in the Vegas sun and it melted the case a little.  It still works!,4
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A3J4DJ03W3UF8O,Killer radio,This radio does a great job of receiving local channels and picks up AM stations from hundred of miles away.,5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A233BX8N5692C6,Great reception for the price,"Within a couple of hours of unpacking this radio and without an external antenna, I was able to hear and identify five AM stations that were each over 500 miles away from my home here in Mesa Arizona: 1 in Salt Lake City, 505 miles; 1 in Denver, 577 miles; 2 in San Francisco, 666 miles; and 1 in San Antonio, 831 miles. I should point out that this was in the evening, when radio signals travel best.One station that has always been problematic for me (KBAQ 89.5 FM transmitting from the other side of Phoenix) came in loud and almost perfectly clear. Unfortunately, selectivity on this radio's FM band is poor (GE chose fidelity over selectivity in this case), so 90.5 FM in Tucson is completely drowned out by 90.3 FM here in Phoenix. After opening the unit and replacing the stock IF filter with a 150 kHz filter (please read the Superadio FAQ on the Internet for more information), I can now pull in 90.5 as well.Thankfully, the radio has a narrow/wide band switch that lets you choose selectivity on the AM band: ""narrow"" for pulling in those hard-to-tune stations, and ""wide"" for getting extra fidelity from closer stations.At $40, it's hard to go wrong with this radio. The next step up would be a shortwave radio like the Grundig S350 ($100) or the Sangean CCRadio Plus ($150).UPDATE: I have only 2 complaints about this radio:1. Moving the volume control has a big effect on volume at low volume, but a small effect at high volume.2. Because this radio doesn't have a digital PLL tuner, it can be difficult to find a specific station when it also picks up so many other stations on the same part of the dial that you weren't looking for.",5

B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A1D0KL9ZD7SU56,One of the best values in radios today,"I've owned my GE superadio III for about 3 months now.  I'd heard a lot of (mostly) favorable things about this legendary series of radios, and had to get one.  I'm glad I did.  Here's what I think.....Strong points:1)  Great AM reception.  Even during the day it's not difficult to pick up stations up to a couple of hundred miles away.  At night, it can be several hundred miles.  This radio has an 8"" ferrite antenna, and when you hook up an external antenna like the C Crane Twin Ferrite, it really gets good.2)  Very good FM reception (although I must admit I mostly just listen to AM talk radio.)3)  Big 2-way speaker puts out nice, full sound.4)  Separate bass and treble controls.5)  Very long battery life (6 D-cells)6)  AC cord included (but not used most of the time.)7)  Great VALUE.  You could easily spend 2 or 3 times as much to get a radio that doesn't approach this performance.Not-so-strong points:1)  It's a big radio.  It won't fit in your pocket or briefcase, but it's no boombox either.2)  The analog tuning dial is not very accurate (as noted by many others.)3)  Build quality is about middle of the road.  (But still good for the price.)4)  No presets, no clock, no weather band, no SWI currently do not own a C Crane Radio Plus, which I find the Superadio III most often compared to, but it's also 1/3 the price.I own a lot of radios (more than 75 at last count).  I listen to this one almost every day (for at least part of the day), so I think that says something.If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive, but highly appreciated gift for a talk radio fan, this is it.  If you're looking for a cool radio for a young person, this probably ain't it.  If you're into talk radio, or you want to have some fun with AM DX-ing, then get one for yourself.",4

B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A2RQKWQP4W3I2M,This Is It!,"Just give me a good AM/FM radio that performs.  The Superadio III does exactly that!  The AM is so potent it's like having AM shortwave - so MANY stations can be found - all over the USA.  The first night I ran it through it's capabilities, from NC we were clear receptioned in Chicago, Miss, Cleveland, NY, and other places that didn't identify.  Great trip.  And the FM reception is exceptional too and the sound is clear, rich and full.Yes, it's on the bulky side, not many bells and whistles, but for the price, it's a real champ.  Trying to convince my wife to get another one.  When it was suggested she could use that one for outside; battle won.  Great radio!P.S. If your battery compartment clips on your super Superadio 111 don't all snap into place, and if you haven't thought of it yet, fold a small piece of paper and wedge it into the 'V' of the offending clip(s) and voilà, the compartment is closed tightly.

B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A3MI3QBXP5I7FA,Better than these folks are saying,"I purchased this item, then in afterthought read the reviews listed here.  So I was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it, and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob.  But the promise of awesome reception was all I needed to hear.First off, I work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference.  I needed something to get past that.  That was my only concern.  So it didn't much matter, as long as I could get past the interference.  Now that you know that, let me tell you about this thing.First of all it's not HUGE.  I'm 40 right now, so I've seen rickety bulky radio's that would kill if it hit you.  This is a nice unit, well sized for the speakers and antenna's in it.Second, it's very well built.  I tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect.  Even the volume, treble and Bass buttons nicely placed on the unit can't be removed without some extra tool.  The switches are only two function switches, and are well built.  Granted it doesn't light up, and the tuner bar isn't a lit bar, but who cares, it's very well built.  I tried to squeeze the unit to see if I could make it crack, no, it's sturdy.Now, for the TUNING ability.  There is a WIDE and NARROW switch, which can either give you a very narrow tuning area, or a much WIDER tuning area.  A station I listen to at 740am appears on the WIDE area from 700 to about 750 on the dial.  However on the NARROW switch, it only comes in within a few millimeters of where 740 is.  That explains why people say the tuning was so bad, they had it set to wide.So all things said and done, how did it do against the interference?  Now basically I'm stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles.  The improvement was marginal.  BUT to my surprise there are additional AM/FM jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to <G>  I grabbed a power cord, wrapped it around the AM port, and between the improvement in tuning, signal grabbing, and the extra antennae, I'm getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissing.This is a very nice radio, well worth every penny I spent on it.  Hope this review helps.Ed Williams, Colorado Springs, CO",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A2Z6K5LQUZU08X,Great for AM DX,"I have always enjoyed listening to far away AM stations at night (DXing) and this radio is one of the better ones for that purpose, even compared to much more expensive radios. It is simple to use with a large internal ferrite antenna. I have never connected it to an external antenna (screws for this are on the back) or antenna tuner, which I imagine would improve reception. Most new radios have digital synthesized tuners and while that adds tuning accuracy, it often adds noise that is bad for DXing. This radio is not the best built and has known quality control issues such as tuning inaccuracies that can be rectified. It isn't tiring to listen to because it has good sound quality due to the large main speaker, tweeter and bass/treble controls. The FM section works very well too. I do not DX FM so can't comment on it's long distance capabilities but it sounds good and holds the stations well. It uses long running D cells but I use the internal AC power supply - the AC cord is permanently attached.There are many reviews of this storied radio on the net you can read so I won't go on and on. It looks like the RCA model replaced the GE but I imagine it is the same radio other than the name on the front.I was fortunate to find a Superadio II at a thrift store and enjoy that earlier model as well.",5

I'm not particularly wild about their redesign of the III's case (the II had a tremendous generic radio look to it), but the reception and audio quality is about the  same. As other reviewers have noted, the dial accuracy is poor, so you have  to ""learn"" each Superadio's setting, but once you learn where  stations are, they stay put.This is a superb radio, with surprisingly  good sound and excellent reception.

B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A3R9KRIO25CKZV,15 Years Old!,"I bought this radio in the early nineties to be my night companion. It's showing signs of wear now, doesn't tune like it used to, and the antenna doesn't stand up anymore (keeps flopping over), but the SuperRadio has been more than worth the money, although I don't remember buying it for as much as they want for it here!",4
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A2BLITJITO97N5,Astounding AM reception,"If you love AM radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios: the ccradio plus and the GE Superadio. These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk, sports, Art Bell, Phil Hendrie, etc. Which one should you buy? I have both (the GE for my office, ccradio for home) so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night, you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away (some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live). There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer, accurate digital tuning, automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time, scan buttons, lighted dial, power cord (not bulky adaptor), weather radio (with auto alert), memory buttons, tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the [$$] for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate. There is no timer, no alarm, no weather, no tv audio, no lit dial, etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio, though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably won't make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station, get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great, almost legendary, reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand, if you love radio, need the extras, change stations a lot, want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime, want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there, go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception (see their website to order). I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day (as some people have tv going on all day). I sleep to radio (and need that sleep timer). I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast, Phil Hendrie, and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me, do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You won't regret it. P.S., the FM reception will be better than you are used to, also.Bottom line: The GE superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky. The CCradio plus is expensive, has every extra you could want (except a decent handle), more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the GE for music.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A2FD03H5CQG76E,Every Household Needs One Of These,"The RCA Superadio is a very sensitive, great sounding AM-FM radio.  It pulls in stations from out of town and out of state, which will expand your listening choices.  (And is just darn interesting to boot.)It is a big, heavy unit - more than 6 pounds with batteries.  Not exactly a iPod, but is fine for carting around the house to listen to while you clean up the garage.This isn't a DXing (long distance radio aficionado)radio.  For that, you would want digital readout and more control over reception characteristics.  This is a radio for those those who love the medium, listen a lot, and want a set that doesn't sound cheap and tinny.This can also make a very good home emergency radio.  Keep it on batteries (I've easily run it more than 100 hours on a set, using it a couple of hours a day) use it for everyday listening while you get ready for work in the morning or make dinner in the evening.  When the power goes out or the alien spaceships land, turn to it to find out what's going on.There are radios that are a skootch above the Superadio in reception and sound - the C Crane CC Radio2 and Sangean PR-D5 among them. But the Sangean is at least twice as expensive, the CC Radio four times so.  For less than $50 you can have a high-quality radio that will serve you for many years.  Every household should have one.Get it while you can - it seems RCA is not making it any more, or have cut back on production - a lot of retailers that stock it are no longer carrying it.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A1QTIQP307ERN3,Great Value!!!,"It is my misfortune to live in a ""fringe"" FM reception area;  the station I regularly listen to is 75 miles away.  I have tried various combination shortwave/AM/FM radios  over the past few years and none had better than ""so-so"" sound on FM.  I'd read about this radio for many years and when I saw it on Amazon , figured it was worth a try.  I have been very pleasantly surprised!  The radio is very large, but has very large speakers that, combined with separate bass and treble controls, produce a very good quality sound.  The tuner section is highly sensitive, even on FM. After I loaded the six D cells into it, I have never even plugged it into the wall and it has been used daily for several hours for many months now. The build quality is a little cheesy, but if it weren't it would weigh as much as an anchor.  If you want good quality audio and reception at a very reasonable price and don't mind a large portable, this is a winner.",4

Solid sound quality, excellent AM receptivity (but only average FM receptivity).But it wasn't very hardy.  I took it camping once, and it was never the same after that.  It took several minutes to ""warm up"" after you turned it on, and then the sound was distorted for several minutes after that.  And scratchy sounds came out of the speaker when you adjusted the volume.  I figure the radio didn't like the humidity of the day and the dew of the morning.",4

I wanted something that had no gimmicks, that plugged into the wall, was analog tuned, so there was no power draw or batteries to worry about when it is off, and so that I know it will last me a LONG time without an LCD failure or whatnot.This radio definitely delivers.  Sound quality is awesome, reception is top notch, and it does exactly what I desired it to. Not small, trendy or stylish - if youre looking for that, go elsewhere.  But for a rugged, quality unit, with good sound from one speaker, you cant do much better.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A6VPIOPMDJ8H7,"Computer-room dwellers of the world, REJOICE!","Some products seem to predict their own futures.  Corning Ware was introduced long before anyone even knew what a microwave oven was and it turned out to be the best cookware for the ubiquitous food zapper.Now, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III takes its place among such prescient products.  Your humble communications technician, seeking to hear another human voice  while on the job in a computer room, found the Superadio III remarkably  well suited to the computer room environment.I had previously brought a  Grundig Yacht Boy 400 and a Sony ICF-2010 to work to listen to an AM talk  radio station, only to find out that what makes them so good for world band  (shortwave) reception are the very things that meant disaster in the  computer room's EMI (electro-magnetic interference) rich atmosphere.  Being  digital receivers, their computer-like circuits eagerly plucked from the  air the squeals, drones and squawks of the network servers, PCs and PBX  system that occupy the room while adding their own synthesizer noise to the  weakened signal.  I pondered the possibilities for better reception.  I  could put the radio nearer an exterior wall, crank up the volume loud  enough to hear while seated at my desk, and be promptly thrown into the  parking lot, since others in the room don't really want to hear the same  station.  Through the interference on the Sony came a commercial for the  CCRadio by C. Crane, a tabletop receiver specially designed for long  distance reception of AM news and talk radio stations (Translation: The  speaker ain't so hot for music).  Pricey but perhaps worth it.I read a  few reviews of the CCRadio and another model kept popping up as the  undisputed CHAMP of Long Distance AM Radio Reception, the standard against  which other contenders are measured, the one, the only, ladies and  gentlemen, let's hear it for the GE 7-2887 Superadio III.  Wow, I thought,  how often I had seen them at WalMart and Kmart and how often I said to  myself, yeah, right, Superadio, ha ha.  Yet, here were some of the  toughest-to-please SOBs who ever twiddled a tuning knob using this radio as THE benchmark.  I was intrigued.A quick visit  to the usual suspects (Best Buy, WalMart, Kmart) proved fruitless  (""Sorry, if it's not on the shelf, we're out. . .No, I don't know when  we'll have more"").  In desperation, I came to Amazon.com, typed  ""superadio"" in the Search box and there it was in all its  ""usually ships in 24 hours"" glory, and for less than  the best street price.  2 UPS Second Day Air days later, it was waiting for  me at home.  I didn't unbox the radio until I was back at work the next  day.Even before digging into my Sausage McMuffin with Egg breakfast, I  unpacked the Superadio III, plugged it in and was, indeed, amazed.  The  interference no longer dominated the signal from Los Angeles radio station  KFI.  It was still there, but not as much as on the Sony and Grundig.  The  Superadio III's analog tuner is, by its nature, more immune to it.  Throwing the WIDE/NORMAL switch to the NORMAL position reduced much of the  interference.  Judicious tuning and adjustment of the separate bass and  treble controls brought forth the desired sound while further fading the  interference to a tolerable level.  Thanks to the 2-speaker sound system,  the Superadio III delivers more ""presence"", allowing it to sound  louder even though the volume might be lower than on a radio with inferior  sound.At the minus end of the scale is the tuning scale itself.  The  aforementioned station at 640 kHz appears between the 650 and 700 markings  (675 kHz?).  If you do a lot of station hopping, keeping a station list  with each's position on the 1-to-10 ""log scale"" above the AM and  FM scales might be a good idea.  Made in China and imported by Thomson  Consumer Electronics, the Superadio III has a less-than-substantial feel to  its construction and controls.  Better-built radios DO come out of China  (can you say ""Grundig""?) but they also cost accordingly.For  its price, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio does just what  you buy it for and will probably continue to do so for many years to come  as more and more computer room hermits discover its ability to bring the  outside world inside.  They can block your access to Web radio, but they  can't stop you from listening.",4
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A3F67ZFU5YMIDD,"Great Reception, Nice sound and excellent battery life.",I Like this radio. Pulls in AM stations great. Has nice sound quality. I've even dropped this on the floor a few times. Still works great. Very durable. Battery life is excellent! Happy with this radio.,5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,ARNWCLQZFQECA,It does one thing right.,"It receives and plays mono radio (AM and FM) exceptionally well.  It sounds great, with surprisingly good bass.At 13""x9""x4"", it isn't small.  And it it isn't light either, with 6 D batteries in it.  But I'll bet this heft is what makes the bass sound so good.I bought it because I wanted a good, inexpensive, big, vertical-format portable radio (I'm tired of the huge footprint and squatting look of most boomboxes today).  I wish it had digital tuning, but it doesn't.  The analog dial might not be very accurate, but in my experience, analog tuning has *never* been accurate.  I've always had to tune by ear rather than eye.Features: Power switch (button) is separate from the volume control.  So you won't be wearing out the volume knob every time you turn it on.  Bass and Treble controls.  A mono headphone out (meant for stereo headphones -- you get the same signal in each ear).  Loud.  Easily fills a good-sized room with sound.  On AM, it has an optional ""wide"" mode which can give you really great sound on some AM stations, at the price of selectivity.  On FM it has optional automatic frequency control which grabs the nearest strong FM signal (you may wish to turn off AFC for weak FM signals near strong stations).  It has terminals for external FM and AM antennas.  It has a nice, 36"" long FM antenna, and a 20cm internal ferrite rod for AM.  It has a nice handle on top, the kind that bangs into the FM antenna if the antenna is extended, so be careful.  There's no light on the tuning dial.  Again, you must tune by ear.Heavy, however, doesn't necessarily mean hardy.  Everything is plastic on it except the antenna and the speaker grille.  Since it is heavy and somewhat tall, I fear the time when it first will fall over.  Best to treat this radio kindly -- I'm not sure how long the switches will last.  But for kindly indoor use, assuming you don't like to switch stations often, it's great.What you are paying for here, though, is the reception, which is excellent.  The Superadio III is not a tank.",4

The thing I like about it is it pulls in the AM stations very well. I listen to a lot of talk radio in the office and the other *cheap* boom box type radios cannot cut through the computer generated RF but this one discriminates and I can hear the stations. Also, the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes. It is also very inexpensive. I would recommend to anyone.",5

B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ,The best radio I have ever owned.,"The GE Superadio III is impossible to beat. Long battery life (6 D cells), superb AM sound that can be made even better on strong signals by switching it to ""wide"" bandwidth mode, and sensitivity that allows me to listen to NY and NJ AM stations during the day at my home in MD, using just the Superadio's built-in antenna.The only way it could be better would be to have a digital frequency display, but the analog ""dial"" is OK enough once you get used to it.The FM section is no slouch, either. Mine picks up a distant high-school station without even extending the antenna. And, the Superadio is also one of only two radios I've ever been able to use at home (near a busy tower) with no front end overload problems at all. (The other radio is a discontinued model that cost 2.5 times as much--in 1970 dollars--as the Superadio does now.)",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A1X3DA7C61WZLQ,By far the best radio,"This is, by far, the best radio you can buy for AM/FM reception.  The AM reception is fantastic, with a super-large internal AM antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hard-core 'DXing.  FM reception is so good you don't need the AFC function, but is only in monaural.  Tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners.  There is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing.The six D-cell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms, power outages, and to tune in far-off stations without electrical interference.  The power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources.The sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble, which is perfect for attenuating static and whine.  The speaker is enormous and the radio features a high-quality tweeter.  The sound quality both on AC and batteries is super-powerful.The volume and bass/treble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but that's the only complaint I have.  The antenna is easily replaced if damaged.  It seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not water-resistant.I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts.  There appears to be some variance in quality between units, such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion, but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker.  Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you're tuning, but I don't think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.This is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale.  The regular price is excessive, though, even for this level of quality.**EDIT**  In 2010, this radio is now known as the RCA Superadio III.  Model numbers include RCA 7-2887 and RCA RP7887.  I am listening to the original, reviewed item right now, and I'm glad to see the line is still being produced even if it is under the throwback RCA brand.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A11ED8O95W2103,Get good reception in difficult areas without spending a fortune.,"Yeah, it's made of plastic.  Don't throw it down the stairs then.  Just put it where you want it and enjoy it.  Now that I've got mine set up where it can pick up stations and I've got the volume and tone set the way I want, all I do with the controls is switch between the same two stations on occasion.  So I suspect this radio will last a while.These radios are especially useful if your home office is partially or completely below ground, like in a finished basement.  Or, if you work in a metal framed office building and you want to listen to talk radio.AM signals are directional.  You need to find the location of the transmitting tower for the station you want to listen to, and then point the radio toward the tower.  That's what I did and I can listen to radio in a place where nobody else can.It's also a good general purpose portable radio for sitting out on your deck listening to the game or music or whatever.  It's not as bulky as a ""boom box"" but it's got better speakers than most portable radios, so it just sounds better in return for a slightly higher price.Postscript:  In all fairness to those who comment on the build quality, I will say that my radio stays in one place tuned to one channel and maybe tuned to a second channel on occasion.  I hardly adjust the controls at all.  So, maybe those who are complaining about the construction quality have a point.  I'm just not using this radio in a way that involves moving it or manipulating the controls much.  It has a very easy life.",5

Its FM is equal to the Grundig S350 and its speaker is even bigger and fuller. I can't overemphasize this speaker. It can fill an entire house. It's the biggest speaker of any radio I own, including my Grundig S350.The Superradio III's AM is leaps and bounds beyond any radio you can buy. No comparison. And the reason is plain: Other radios have a conventional four-inch internal ferrite AM antenna. The Superradio's ferrite antenna is in contrast eight inches.Weak points? Well, the cheap build quality and you have to suffer with a less than precise spin dial. Also some don't like its huge size. But for the price I can't fault the radio. For strong AM/FM reception with a big full speaker than can fill a huge room, look no further. Buy a Superradio III for one-fourth the cost of radios that won't give you as much bang for your buck.At this price point, the Superradio III blows away the competition.",5

(The Superadio and the RS 12-603/12-903 are often compared out on various pages on the internet and have the exact same features.)  My goal was to receive my favorite FM station, which is a weaker station sandwiched between two strong stations.  The Superadio, with the help of a C. Crane FM Reflect antenna found at ..was the only radio/antenna combo that would bring it in for me. (I also tried 3 other antennas, including 2 amplified antennas)  Another nice item is that I get excellent FM reception on almost every channel now.  The ability to turn off the Auto Frequency Control seems to make all the difference for my needs.  The RS 12-903 had the same switch, but I didn't notice a significant difference when I turned it on or off, like I do with the Superadio.  The only thing the RS 12-903 had going for it was it's sturdier case, but it was  more, even on sale.  I haven't done much with AM, so I can't comment on that.  I hope this is helpful.",5

I've even tried playing music through up to eight IIIs (yes, eight!) to see if the lack of musical sound quality was due to simple lack of amplification; it's not.(2)  Both IIIs that have stopped working for me did so because the on-off (silver) button while appearing to be in the down-on position in fact wasn't low enough to turn the III on.  Fortunately one can solve this problem by wedging a dime between the button and the case.(3)  Should you try to tune to the same station using multiple IIIs at the same time (as I do), there's a noticeable variation between IIIs in where on the dial that same station appears.Considerations:(1)  Sounds best when both bass and treble are at halfway on (that is, if the control were numbered from 1 to 10, it would be at 5).(2)  The bass control adds more distortion that bass.(3)  The headphone jack takes a stereo (mini) plug (even though not surprisingly the sound through the headphones is monaural), which I consider to preferable to a monaural jack, because effectively all headphones have stereo plugs.(4)  According the the User's Manual, that Normal-Wide button works only on AM, not FM.",4

We went through a half dozen radios attempting to find something that could grab a specific PBS station we enjoyed most, KQED from San Francisco.Can you imagine hearing Garrison Keillor over a crystal set?Things changed for the better only after we followed a recommendation in Amazon to this GE portable.Somehow, I think it is a tuner knob that is a precise as a laser knife and a tuning band that seems a foot and a half wide, we can nail the signal.  After that it is a matter of playing with AFC, bass, treble and a view other variables to pull in a signal that is not only there but pretty good.The only real drawbacks come from sun spots: when they flaired we could could hear them.

BUT, the radio that I received is bad. Intermittently, the volume goes down to nothing..I can hear it only humming..A one year warranty comes with it and I bought mine about two months ago.. It's going back but I'm afraid that since the problem is intermittent, it won't be fixed.. Been there, done that..Never the less, it's a great radio as far as reception..Guess what? I bought another one today.. One for work, one for home use.. I'm sure I'll have to do without the original for a while it's being repaired though.I rate this radio very high for sound quality and reception (design) yet very low for quality of the build..

B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,ADNV4SOGOMZXP,I've owned two for fifteen years -- fantastic,"This is just a fantastic product.I've owned two for fifteen years and hope they never stop making this model in case I want another.The sound is great, the reception is great, the price (was) great; the durability is great and the battery usage is great.  It's all great.It is certainly not ""feature rich"" but who needs all that nonsense for AM and FM radio?  More feature would just get in my way.TIP: The radio has a ground screw on the back which I'm guessing most people don't use. After hooking up a long wire outdoor antenna, I noticed that what really helped AM DX reception was the ground!I bought a grounding rod from Radio Shack to isolate the radio from the noisy house wiring system. (I pounded in the rod in the ground outside the house.) That REALLY helped! So much so, that I removed the wire antenna and now only use the ground.",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A1J1ORDE07JZ46,My GE version still good after 10 years!,"I ordered one of these right here on Amazon back in Jan 2004, my specimen was probably manufactured in 2003. I should use it more than I have, but it still works very well. Of all my other radios, only the old Panasonic ""all-chrome""  model(RF-1600?) can shade it on AM, and the difference is *very* small, at best. On FM, the extra long whip antenna really helps here in the semi-sticks, and it does very well, if not quite up to my little Grundig G8 with DSP. Sound from the big speaker is excellent. Recently I've begun using it late on Sat nights to listen to 1120 AM from St. Louis- a long way from NE Texas! Fades in/out a bit less than my best smaller radios on that. Mine even has a fairly accurate tuning scale- tunes 650 WSM with the needle centered on the ""6"" of ""650"", 1200 WOAI with needle on the ""2"" of ""1200""- certainly too close to try & modify. Battery life is looong, too- manual states about 400 hrs on 6 alkaline D-cells. Want to use AC instead? Power cord & transformer are built-in, no wall wart to get lost.Warts? Power switch seems a little fragile, no light for the slide-rule  dial. Some will miss a tuning LED lamp, and though it will handle headphones, no FM stereo through 'phones.Best testimony I've seen was from someone near New Orleans who had no power for weeks after Katrina, all local radio stations were knocked off-air, he used one of these as his primary radio to get news & info over AM stations.I've read lots of reviews stating that the later versions sold under the RCA name are problematic. Maybe so- but if you can find one of the GE models at a reasonable price somewhere- and you like radios- my advice is get it quick before someone else does!",5
B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,A1MD9AEU9C4WJN,Good value,"I just purchased this radio. It has an excellent reception comparable to portable radios that cost over [price], and the quality of sound is very good.Pros:- reception quality on both AM and FM bands;- has a built-in power cord, may use batteries as well.- attractive price for the quality you get.Cons:- a bit heavy, I assume primarily due to speakers (it has two, one of which is quite large) and built-in power adapter;- cavity in the back to hide the thick power cord can barely accommodate the cord; I managed to back it back after several tries.- vernier (non-digital) tuning and no ability to pre-program stations; at the same apparently due to excellent reception, dial range for stations is very large, so tuning to a station is not a problem at all.- built-in power adapter makes a constant humming noise that at lower volume levels can be heard within 2-3 ft form the radio; I assume this is not a problem when using batteries.",4

It's all true.  But quality of product is just horrible.  Look, I formerly lived in Ukraine and Soviet Union and to tell you the truth I haven't seen such horrible finish and quality in Soviet portable radios.  Quality or a lack of it is just appalling.  The tuning knob will fell off very soon.  There's no soft material under battery door-so battery rattle (I put some paper inside it cured rattle).  I understand this product made in China, but look you can buy Sony, Grundig, or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in China, as a matter of fact, almost everything nowdays made in China.  It's not a question whether or not something made in China it's a matter how good it made there.  This radio is obviously was made in garage in China.  Just tell me why, but why there's no light on tuning scale, how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb.  GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all.  I wouldn't ever buy this product for looks.  It looks awful, but reception on AM is excellent, yes it is.",4

B00000J061,GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,AJZ0V9Q3ZVYWV,Excellent AM radio,"That's right - excellent AM radio. Good for news and talk radio, good for music of the 70's also, a true re-production of the 70's impression. :-) For AM programming, this is my choice. However, for FM and concert music, I go with Trevolie Model One, it's simply amazing and inspiring. And for an all around portable radio, the Grundig S350 is my choice, it is much more refined and functional. All three are keeper in my book. In my search of a portable radio, I bought all three within two month time frame and am very happy with the flexibility and quality I get.follow up to my initial review back to August 2004, my superadio is still on the first set of battery and working nicely, no trouble whatsoever. So far, I am convinced if it does not pick up the signal (both AM and FM), pretty much that's it; the station is out of range. I use it mostly for AM, yet, FM reception is just as good. By itself and tuned at a moderate leve, the sound quality is ok. Overall, a nice radio and well worth the money.",5

The reason being that these new Metal stylus' will improve your grafitti skills 10-fold!  Another convenient feature of this stylus is that the top unscrews to reveal a reset tip.

Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three)  have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more  like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically  easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the  screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for  the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a  stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the  plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my  girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly  go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one,  buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",5

These metal styli don't exhibit that problem. The extra weight also ""feels better"" in a way I can't describe otherwise. (It's not THAT much heavier, but it does feel more comfortable in your hand.) The best feature, though, is that unscrewing the top gets you to a built-in reset tool.

Or, better yet, toss the original stylus in favor of one of the replacement  stylii. The cheap metal stylus that comes with the Palm III is hard to use  because it is too light. (I have carpal tunnel syndrome and found the  original equipment stylus aggravated it because of how hard I ended up  gripping the stylus.) These replacement stylii are a heavier metal, which  is easier to hold and considerably more accurate. Highly recommended.",5

They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal. That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers. In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours, so in my case it was very noisy making this adapters a total waist of money. I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me.

B00000J08Q,RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack,A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,"Nearly Worthless, save yourself the aggravation and just run a phone line","I purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom. Because of old wiring in the house, the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available. While I use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room, I needed a phone jack so my Tivo could dial out and get programming information. When set up, the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them. I purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that I could use it almost anywhere in my house. After a lot of effort, I find the unit to be nearly worthless.The range is VERY limited. I made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else (furniture, electronics, etc.) were in the way, yet there was no dial tone. I moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units, and I did get a dial tone, but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to. I couldn't imagine using it with an electronic device (like a modem or Tivo) that sends data. I got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within 15 to 20 feet of each other. Needless to say, with that kind of configuration, it's easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard.",1

B00000J08Q,RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack,ALDA72MNSJVOK,Fine for Satellite Receivers Including Tivos,"I use the RC926 to add an extra phone jack for my DirecTivos and standalone DirecTV receiver.  All three receivers are split off from the extension jack and I have never had a problem with the units making the required service data call.Edit: I also have DSL but use 2Wire filters (not the generic filters provided by Verizon) for greater clarity.  A filter has to be placed between the jack and the wireless BASE unit for the wireless extension unit to function properly with DSL.Note:  Tivos and DirecTivos DO HAVE MODEMS so Rios' title header is somewhat misleading. But the facts in the body of the review are correct. Per Page 10 of RCA's manual (which is available on their website): ""Note: The maximum baud rate for the Wireless Phone Jack is 14,400. Best results, however, will be experienced at 9,600.""  This limitation is why I knocked off a star.So yes, I would not recommend that you attempt to surf the Internet using this jack or use it for any purpose where a high baud rate is important.  But the phone jack is perfectly fine for voice, fax, and satellite receiver use.",4
B00000J08Q,RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack,A3NEAETOSXDBOM,Average product,"I used to have a second phone line in an upstairs room that I used primarily for faxing and occasional phone calls. When I got rid of that line, I bought this wireless phone jack so that I could use my main phone line in the upstairs room without paying the phone company the considerable cost of running new wires.The product does work even though the base station is connected to a phone jack in a room that is not only downstairs, but is also separated by multiple doors and walls from my upstairs room, which is in another part of the house.This unit has enabled me to use my phone/fax machine to send and receive faxes without any problems.  Making phone calls is a different story. Although there is always some ""noise"" on the line, sometimes it is so minimal that I can easily make a phone call and carry on a conversation. But other times the ""noise"" is so loud that it is not possible to use the phone to call someone.Bottom line: faxing is always possible, but voice conversations sometimes are not.

I used it for a few months  and was pretty happy with it.  It was comfortable on my head, easy to  adjust, sounded good, and I never got any complaints from people I was  talking to.Then it broke.So now I'm about to shell out some more  money for the AT&T headset and I figured I'd share my new found wisdom  with everyone else.",2

The only probem is that my wife wears one of these all day and was not happy to wear this at home.  I used it a few time when I work on my computer and need help.  Sound quality is fine.  If I had to do over, I might have looked into a wireless. Don't get me wrong, it works fine. It's that I don't really need it with my speaker phones.",4
B00000J0D2,Uniden HS910 Headset for Cordless Phones,A3DJ8DG0WPNXQA,Garbage. Connector designed to break at tip,"This is the worst headset I have ever owned. I bought so many of them over the years I don't remember anymore how many went bad. At least 10. The reason I keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets don't work well with a Uniden cordless phone. Uniden requires a specific impedance, otherwise voice quality is not good.Calling Uniden is worthless. They are of no help.I actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the 2.5mm plug.I'm not buying anymore Uniden phones or headsets.",1

I only bought this thing to get a credit on my DISH network bill. (They don't tell you they charge per month if you don't have it plugged into a phone line, just that you get a credit each month if you do.) For one year, it doesn't pay, but for a 2-YR contract, it pays itself off after the first year.

This was very good for my needs, but I did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets.  I also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would ""talk"" to each other and transfer the caller ID signal; but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlessly.",4
B00000J0D5,RCA RC930 Caller-ID-Compatible Wireless Modem Jack,A8TZ88OM8YOLW,A Poor Man's Wireless Network -- That Works!,"I've used the RCA RC930 Wireless Modem Jacks to create a poor man's wireless network in my home.  It works!  And I love it!  I can now sit in any chair of my house, surf the web, and print (across the room) to my wireless HP 995 Bluetooth printer.My system consists of two sets of RCA Wireless Modem Jacks (a sender and receiver unit in each set) -- one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs (which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected); a 3Com Bluetooth PC card for my laptop; and a HP 995 Bluetooth printer.I now use my laptop in the following manner: first, I plug the RCA receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where I want to sit; then I turn on the printer; and finally, I extend the little blue tooth-shaped antenna (how cute!) on the laptop's PC card -- and I'm all set to go!The RCA Modem Jack is good up to 56k, which is ok since I don't have internet cable or DSL service in my area.  But I'll gladly trade-off mobility for speed any day.  Here's why.My desktop computers (old and new) are in my upstairs bedrooms -- where I can't use them when my family is sleeping.  They are also far away from where my family spends most of its time -- and that's downstairs by the TV's.With the RCA wireless modem jacks, I can now access the internet --- while watching TV with my family; and I can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep -- when internet speeds are fastest.  The connection is fairly clean (free of static); and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if I had accessed the phone jack directly.I've gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net. When cable or DSL eventually come to my neighborhood, I guess I'll have to set up a wireless network in my home (for a lot more money) -- in order to maintain my mobility.Until then, I'll use the next best thing -- RCA's Wireless Modem Jacks.  They're great!",5

This unit is really lousy. I called tivo for an unrelated issue one day, and the guy on the phone said ""you're using one of those wireless modem things aren't you"" - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir. I didn't know because the tivo managed to mask the failures, but after trying several online tivo updates, I got to finding out how much this really doesn't work. I have a series 2 tivo now and am using an 802.11 network which is infinitely better and faster.",4

B00000J0D5,RCA RC930 Caller-ID-Compatible Wireless Modem Jack,A83N14T7FQV82,Skip it and have a line installed,"The wireless modem/phone jack idea is a great one, but it rarely works the way it is intended.  Whether it's interference from other electronics, old house wiring, or any number of things, it tends to have a poor signal resulting in a bad connection.  If you're using this for either a modem, security system that requires a phone line, or a telephone jack, it's likely not going to give you the results you want.  My recommendation would be to go ahead and have a phone drop and jack installed and call it a day.  It may be a more expensive option, but it's by far the best one.",2

The stations are about 20 feet apart with a wall and furniture in between, but I have not had connectivity issues.  I have two wireless networks (b and g)in the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned.  That said, my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a 15 ft. line-of-sight installation with no other wireless networks, so the system seems to be somewhat picky.",4

I'm on Amazon right now buying replacements (ANOTHER BRAND) for these that have completely failed. They worked fine at first, then got fuzzier. One quit completely tonight, no power..nothing. The other still ""works"" with lots of fuzz. I find myself re-tuning the signal a lot. Time for a replacement. If you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand. I'm trying the Acoustic Research AW-871s now. They supposedly have better range. Don't settle for cheap unless you have to. You'll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long! Don't say we didn't warn you!",2
B00000J0D8,RCA WSP150 900 MHz Wireless Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer),A21Q1LBZP2671X,Pretty Good Speakers,I got these for Christmas one year and had a really difficult getting good sound out of them. I wanted to use them for my PC to play music around the house. At first I would get very soft sound and sometimes no sound at all. I shelved them for a while and then decided to try them on my PC again with a Soundblaster 16 sound card. Excellent sound. These speakers are not for the impatient person. I do have the transmitter sitting on the top floor on a high shelf so that it can get go transmission. The transmitter can not be surrounded by anything. I can get a good 100 ft out of the speakers. Then I start losing signal. There are times that I get a beeping sound of them. For some reason that does subside. I do recommend them for the price. Beware it might take some time to find the right niche for them.,3
B00000J0D8,RCA WSP150 900 MHz Wireless Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer),ANU1675O6DO5E,Good enough that I want to buy a THIRD pair!,"I bought two and use them in different parts of the house to listen to my Sirius Satelite radio. I can walk around the house and listen to either Howard or the Rolling Stones channel through out, using one boom box.There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these.* A) * Set the volume going into the transmiter higher. 2) Low volume in will cause popping and fading. Very low volume in will for some reason cause the transmitter to shut down. 2) Higher volume in will allow you to lower the preamp volume on the speakers and play with less distortion and lower noise level. When you increase the volume on the speakers, you are amplifying the NOISE as well as the music. Makes sense, right?B) The power cord is also part of the antenna, so its location and position can be adjusted to improve reception. I used little plastic wire ties to afix the cord to speaker stands. The cord runs straight down like a verticle antenna.C) The speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence. You can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers (speakers). Fine tune them for the best reception in your location. This may take a few adjustsments. Remember, cellphones, WIFI etc can all interfere!I tried plugging the transmitter into my stereo's headset jack, but it didn't work well, because the output was too low. I'm going to cut the plugs off of the Y adapter or make an adapter with bare wires and try using them as the rear (effects) channel of my home theater.I love these speakers and use them everyday. They could be a little better, but I still love them! I'd give them 5 stars if they were a little louder, a little better tone wise and the reception range was a little better. You'd get 150' in an open feild or gymnasium, not my odd shaped house. But for the money, they are a great VALUE!My house is made concrete & steel and has metalic tinted glass all over, so wireless stuff doesn't work the greatest. With my windows closed & the tranmitter on my patio, I get about 30' with occaisional drift. Your house might be better. I'm going to buy another pair because I see that they are discontinued and these sound better than the newer ones. I'm also concerned that the new ones may have differnt frequencies, which is a good thing if you want to use more than one pair at a time, connected to different inputs.Better hurry up and buy now, before I get buy all!",4
B00000J0IX,Magellan GPS 315 Waterproof Hiking GPS,A3JTWZNUVOL2K1,"not bad, but maps are better",Liked the reception of this vs. the Garmin unit I had previously. But soon learned that maps are the way to go. I upgraded to a Map330 soon after trying the 315.,3
B00000J0IX,Magellan GPS 315 Waterproof Hiking GPS,A3DH74L21G9QFJ,a must have toy,"Having spent 2 hours with the Magellan 315 on a camping weekend in Arizona's mountains, I can say that the unit is all that's advertised. The manual is cryptic, but once you get used to the customizing menus and 9 available navigation screens, the rest is pretty intuitive. I was able to create a waypoint, walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet. It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest. It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint (with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website)! As long as you keep moving, the compass feature is quite good. It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.Nice screen, plenty of options and quite accurate. When used in your car, it tracks your speed to .1 mph, with updates given each second.  If you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover, this is a nice addition. I suspect on an open lake, this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots.",4

By the time i find the place im trying to get ive passed it and gone another 20 miles.  Also, mine was working fine when suddenly one day i turned it on and it said it had no maps and i needed a upload.  So i downloaded the latest patch for it, and tried uploading with no success.  I have gotten a number from Magellan to return it, but lost the number (actually my dad did) So im returning it :(  but i must say it was great while it worked, and the tech support is fast and reliable.",5

B00000J0IX,Magellan GPS 315 Waterproof Hiking GPS,A2OMVQGC33VSNC,GPS 315 good but has big problems,"I purchased the GPS 315 in December after using another brand for five years. The GPS315 represents a big improvement with better, quicker satelite acquistion, a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user  to use the sun or moon to  correct bearing. This way the user is not having  to pull out a compass to check bearing. Additional pluses are its small  size and light weight using only two AA batteries lasting up to 15 hours.  If weight is a concern, that is big. My previous unit used four and lasted  five hours. Problems: The manual is as sorry as it can get. It barely  covers TrackRoute, Track History, Backtrack, and Reverse Route. These are  major important features left to the user to figure out. I have yet to  figure them out consistently. With Track History there seems to be an  ability to set a scale, but what scale? Nothing tells me. Is it how often  it records a waypoint in history?I have emailed the company with  questions twice, called once (had to leave a voice mail because they were  not taking calls), faxed once. Heard nothing from their customer  no-service. I wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts. Oh yes, my GPS  315 crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old.  Glad I wasn't in the middle of 40,000 acres. You can't zoom in on a  waypoint if it is very far away from your current location. Actually to do  so but you have to set a scale of .1 or .2 and Pan & Scan to it. If is  is 50 miles away, you can imagine how long that could take.",3

Find a flat surface, lay a bundle of tissue on it, place the disk scratched face up.  Place a couple drops of #1 abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward (you don't have to wait 5 minutes).  Keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry (about 5 minutes).  Spray once with #2, and using a clean TISSUE, continue wiping VERY GENTLY radially outward until #2 dries.  Try the disk.  If it doesn't work, repeat all the above until it does.  This really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches.

It's about half-way down the cord.  If you use them at a desk and move much, you'll constantly pull the pack off of the desk and it'll fall with a sharp jerk to your headphones.  The Sonys only used a single AAA battery but the Maxells use two.  So, Sony was able to put it in a compartment on the headphone band with no aggravation.  Oddly, the Sonys seem to have much better battery life for me.  The Maxells do enclose the ears much better to help block sounds, but they do start to hurt your ears after prolonged use.  If you wear them for hours at a time, the similarly priced Sonys are easier on the ear.  I'm not wild about the way the Maxells fold up, either.  The Sonys kind of spin in and make for much flatter storage.  Another problem with the Maxells is a loud creaking sound from the plastic.  Often just moving your jaw seems to produce a loud plastic-on-plastic noise that comes through quite loud.  With a slight re-design, Maxell could have a nice set of headphones.  Wait until then or try another brand.",2

Only one complaint, as others have mentioned, problems with the power jack. Within a month, it got loose and had to keep jiggling it to get it charging. Took it back to the store I got it, and they gave me a brand new one one the spot. But, several months later, the new one had the same problem. Brought it back again. This time I had to wait 2 weeks to get it repaired. Two months later, same problem. Another 2 week repair. I'm striving to not move it at all while it is plugged in, but heck, it's a laptop! Anyway, if it happens a fourth time, my warranty says they have to give me a new one.",4

I put them on, turn them on and then just SLEEP for the flight.AWESOME.",4
B00000J1EJ,Maxell 190400 Noise Cancellation Headphone,A294CSQXGL76CV,Depends on the type of noise,These headphones were disappointing. I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the low-frequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20 - 30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums.,2
B00000J1EJ,Maxell 190400 Noise Cancellation Headphone,A16RGMORD80K9V,These have worked great for several years...,"Ive had the Maxell NC II over a couple of years & they are still holding up well.I now use these headphones primarily at home to relax in the recliner while listening to music or taking an undisturbed nap.I originally got them because I was a long haul truck driver & the engine & wind noise was just wearing me out not to mention having to turn the radio up too loud just to hear it.These headphones helped to stop that.The noise canceling feature is effective in reducing the ambient noise around me creating a much more relaxed, stress free environment.At the end of the day I wasnt nearly as tired as when I didnt use the headphones.Im not an audiophile so I cant give you stats & freq #s but I enjoy my music, books on tape & movies more using these headphones.I also like the collapsible, over the ear design. They are comfortable & I havent had any problems with them getting hot after wearing them over an extended time.The battery life is very good, the electrical cord is a good length & the on/off switch is sturdy with a small green light when on.Im going to upgrade to the NC IV for home & keep my NC II for in the car.",4
B00000J1EJ,Maxell 190400 Noise Cancellation Headphone,A1X0990QXMJIY7,"Consider them ""disposables""","I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine, if you don't move your head. Now it's October and the sound in that ear is gone for good. That good price for noise cancelling headphones, isn't so great for only 5 months. Guess they are meant to be disposable.Don't waste your money!",1
B00000J1EJ,Maxell 190400 Noise Cancellation Headphone,A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,Good product if it could last...,"I purchased these headphones before traveling to Europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great.  The sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice.  The battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains.  I used it on both flights with great relaxation and I also used it on the Chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction.The weight, length of cord, and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable.  They are made of plastic and feel very fragile.  I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch.  But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.In other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design.  After only about a month, one of the wires split and I lost the right headphone completely.  And forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing.I am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again.  If not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the price.",2
B00000J1EJ,Maxell 190400 Noise Cancellation Headphone,A311UKPJDYZOVL,"Cheap Headphones, there are much better options for the money","I've never felt a need for noise cancellation headphones, but I received these as a gift. Fortunately, no one spent a lot of money on them, because they really seem cheap to me. The construction is flimsy, and they're bulky. Maxell might as well have included a paper sack to carry them in, as the bag that comes with them is not much more than that. It offers no protection to the headphones at all.I just can't see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce carry-on space. I don't see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get: these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off. With noise cancellation on, the sound is even worse. It's flat and lifeless.I had recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser PX-100s. They sound vastly better for the money. They fold down super-compactly into a nicely-designed case and even cost a few bucks less.I don't know about the expensive noise-cancellation headphones, but I would rather have a better pair of regular headphones for this price.",2
B00000J1EJ,Maxell 190400 Noise Cancellation Headphone,ATY86XH2DJ4ZH,not really a noise cancelling headset,"I am not an audiophile, but I do care about the sound I hear. I bought this headset last week mainly for the time I spend removing snow in winter. I wanted a headset that covers my ears well, while sounding OK. I thought this noise cancelling phone would be a great choice, especially because my snowblower is terribly loud. Well, it does cover my ears comfortably well, but unfortunately thats all that is good about this headset. It isnt particularly great sounding, and the biggest disappointment was noise cancellation - rather the lack of it. It is hard to perceive much difference between NC being on or off!! It does suppress some, so I know it is on, but it can hardly suppress anything real. I quickly gave up any hope about its use with snowblower, but I then found it cant do much about the sound of my home's furnace as well - which is barely audible even without a headset.. bummer.I have a Sony MDR-NC6 that I have been using for the past 2 years or so. It still works great, just that it doesnt have a cupped headset to cover my ear. If that is not one of your criteria, I highly recommend it. It sounds way better, is cheaper (at least now it is), noise cancellation works great too. See my review there.",2

B00000J1EP,MAXELL NORMAL BIAS UR-90 (15-Pack) Standard Size Cassettes,A2R6RA8FRBS608,fine normal bias 90 minute tape though it could stand a little improvement,"Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape, as one reviewer correctly notes, make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.75 for the fifteen-pack you spend roughly 45 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II; but it's still not the same as a digitized CD-R recording. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.",4

I don't even have a tape player anymore.Both projects are lamps made out of either just the cassette tapes or the tapes in their cases.  Thought I would give both a try and see which I liked better.I really like the first one better, I bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the base.I have also seen people spray paint these neon colors and hang them from string in rooms, put on walls.

B00000J1F3,Maxell 213030 VHS T160 Standard Grade - 3 Pack,A1QVS34FWGRAVG,Reliable standard,"I have found Maxell to be one of the reliable VHS tapes.  (Sony and TDK I have always found good too.) For those who don't know, the 160 minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a 120.  When tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity. Therefore I don't recommend 160 for repeated reusing but for some long thing, or somethings adding up to 8 hours (at SP) to save and watch sometime.  The 120s I use and reuse a lot, and keep a lot too.  :-)  Long may the VCR's survive.P.S.  oooops! Made an error above.  I said 8 hrs. at SP. Of course, we all know SP is the fastest. LP or SLP - whichever your VCR has as slowest is what I meant. Fast speed recording is considered best by some. Pause at SP gives a jerky picture. At SLP you can pause and get a quite steady look at a particular shot, and the overall clarity and quality of the recording I consider quite OK.",5
B00000J1F3,Maxell 213030 VHS T160 Standard Grade - 3 Pack,A25E8V5JMW43RY,Great recording tapes,These are wonderful for recording anything you like if you still have a VCR!  I will use them and order more!,5
B00000J1F3,Maxell 213030 VHS T160 Standard Grade - 3 Pack,A2I9XSZSHXQ3OZ,Maxell T160 8 hrs,I bought this pack specifically because each tape is 8 hrs long. This length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty long.The quality of the picture is still pretty good even at 8 hrs. So far I have had no problems with these tapes. I suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise.I got these at a good price(just under seven bucks) on Amazon. VHS tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so I am glad I can still purchase these on Amazon.,5

I have a VHS tape eraser, which is a giant magnet, so when after viewing my recorded program I erase them to record another program.  Very durable.  Can be reused over and over again, best when you erase with the tape eraser, otherwise you will see your old program under your new program.  I recommend this product.  I rate this a 5 star.",5

B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),A2I9LWY5PN73YI,Great Product!,"I use these at work, and the sound is great and the cord frees me from my desk.  (I often have to travel around the building.)  I work with computers andI wasn't sure how it would work with all of the electrically noisy  equipment around us but it works great!  Highly recommended!",5
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),A1TAFEUKHIFV6L,Good headphones at first; didn't last long,"[December 2000]I really like these headphones.  I also tried the Sony RF950-RK, which is in a comparable price range.What I liked about Sony:  longer battery life (15 hr instead of 6 hr); there's a stand on which you can hang your headphones; there's an auto on-off feature that saves battery life.What I didn't like about Sony:  you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit (I was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge, like the Palm Pilots do in their cradles); when I tilt my head forward (at my desk, since I use these at work), they slide off.What I like about Advent:  the sound is slightly better; the battery recharging is easy (plug it in and it recharges); they are more comfortable than the Sonys.What I didn't like about Advent:  there's no recharging stand; the tuning knob is in a really bad place (where you'd put your hands when you're putting the headphones on).I didn't really care about the range, because I'm really only using them in the same room.  One thing to be aware of: the Advent instruction manual (which nobody reads) says you should plug them into the LINE OUT and not the SPEAKER OUT port.  The line out has a much stronger signal (unless you turn up the volume on the sound source).  There's also an adjustment knob you're supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level.  Before I did these two things, I got a lot of noise.  After I read the instructions and set up a strong signal, I had almost no noise.Overall I really love them.  I can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate, and they're comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble.[December 2003]I no longer use these headphones for day to day use.  After about six months, I got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out, the increasing amount of hiss, and the random loss of stereo signal.  I'm back to using regular wired headphones, this time spending only $18 on an Aiwa pair that I like.  I still use the Advent wireless headphones for occasional TV viewing (where sound quality is not so important), but I wouldn't recommend them.",2
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),A204ETWOV23HO4,Pretty darn good,"Not the highest fidelity you will ever hear in a headphone, but if you aren't in a recording studio, and are just listening to music while sitting at home or cleaning, or watching the TV and want headphones so as not to disturb the neighbors, these are perfect. They have more than enough range - I can even go well outside, and still hear the music just fine. They are not quite five stars, though, due to not being fully 'fi', so to speak, and for the annoying need to use another plug cord to recharge the batteries.As far as some other reviewers talking about complications with tuning, maybe I just lucked out, but I had these things tuned in about three seconds. I've also never lost a signal randomly, or had the tuning slowly go out of phase as some others complained.  I will say, though, that the tuning knob on the headphones is right next to the volume knob, and it's very easy to accidentally bump the tuning knob when adjusting the headphones, or when one wants to adjust the volume.  But this is a minor complaint (though I would like to see advent begin to put the tuning knob on the side opposite the volume, or in some other less easily accesible spot).The lows are good, the highs are good, and the ear cushions are very comfy, even for my large head, for extended periods.  The cushions I find to hold in heat from my ears and cause sweating (sorry if that's gross, but you need to know this stuff to be informed). I've always had that problem with all cushioned headphones since many, many ages ago, and so is not a problem with just these headphones, but the Advents cause it sooner than others I have owned - they make a very airtight seal around your ears.For the price, and for the built-in rechargable batteries, these are an excellent deal in my opinion, and I've enjoyed having them and using them, and have just ordered another pair so that my partner and I both can use them to watch movies with explosions and/or loud orchestral soundtracks late at night.",4
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),A18PDUB7HSEP10,Nothing wrong with these at all...,"Fine sound, good reception over a decent range (looks like I can get around the yard without them making any big complaints), comfortable.I would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds I'm used to.  And the separation is better than I expected.  There is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on, but I'm pretty picky and I think its totally tolerable.",4
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),AI7FG0JAGX77B,Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones,"Overall very pleased with the product. The phones are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house & yard. The quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good. There is an ample supply of cables & adapters, i.e., for plugging into  a computer soundcard.",4
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),AWWBZZXN32I6H,"Easily breakable headset, charging suggestion","I'm not brutal with equipment, but in a few short weeks, the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side. Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep. A second convenient bedside charger would be nice. I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge. If you're a  late night TV watcher, you too might call this justifiable laziness. Too many times I put them on the next night and find the battery's down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless, I'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone.",1
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),A1665GGGDM0ZPO,Wireless in North Carolina,"Terrific value for the money.  Sound is very clear and warm.  Upper range and midrange as good as very expensive corded  phones and speaker systems. The bass is not muddy, but it  is less pronounced than with good speakers or corded phones. But the overall sound is still excellent.Requires a good deal of adjustment and fiddling to get the best sound and longest transmition range out of it. Don't set the level on the transmitter too high. You will get speaker overload. You can listen throughout your home, patio, and garage.  But you generally get some bursts of static as you walk. None of these drawbacks bothers me.Best for listening to CD's. Sounds great with LP's too, but it transmits more groove wall noise and static than you  are probably used to hearing from the RIAA jacks that your turntable is connected to.",5
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),A2KAU5BF41AKHN,A solid product but could have been better,"These headphones are a decent wirless solution but are a tale of two realities.Reality 1 - When charged and properly tuned, they sound great; rich bass and full mid range with good highs. Their range is excellent - I have listened to music for 3-4 hours about 100 feet from the base. They are adjustable and accomodate different size heads easily.Reality 2 - The challenge of keeping them tuned and charged is not always easily accomplished. The battery setup and charging arrangement could have been done significantly better. Also unless you want to be adjusting the levels alot you need a fixed level signal. Additionally since the frequency reception is quite contingent upon battery strength, if you don't have the time or means to keep the battery charged to certain levels your performance suffers.Since I am a bit of a techno geek being mindful of charging and frequency adjustment is not a big deal, but others (like my wife) will find it a hassle.",3
B00000J1GA,Audiovox Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones (Silver),AOZB4GES5J7FK,Not a good product,".... When I dropped them a day after getting them home, the right earpiece shattered, revealing the inside of a very cheap product. .... The description doesn't tell you that you have to tune the transmitter, then tune the headset until the signals coincide. That takes a little doing to get it right, and I find that the two parts lose each others' signal several times over the course of a couple of hours. I have to re-tune the base and the headset each time they lose each other. It also has an annoying whine most of the time also. Since last XMas, it seems like this is the only wireless headphone product in the retail stores, which is a shame because it is so bad.",1

Then I thought, hey, why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe it'll work.  It did!  The cleaner is extremely easy to use.  You insert the cleaner disk into your CD player and follow the directions, which are said aloud to you, and in no time the cleaning is done.  After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you, too.  I ejected the cleaning disk, inserted one of my CDs and voila!  It was working again!",5

B00000J1QK,Allsop CD Laser-Lens Cleaner,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,Definitely works - a must have,"I purchased this from Amazon 4 years ago and here it is 4 years later and it still works perfectly.  I had to write a review on such a great product.  It is a definite inconvenience when any of your electronic pieces hit the road.  Your television, cd player, receiver, computer, etc.  These are all necessities and if any of them break down they must be replaced immediately regardless of budget.I live in a highrise apartment right in downtown Boston and there is much dust.  When a cd player starts acting up you don't know what's going on at first.  If its dead, its dead.  But if cds are skipping or playing errartically what do you do?  Is it the player itself?  First you clean the cds.  Maybe its a simple problem.  Well, my cd player was having a field day at the time - cds jumping and skipping all over.  I purchased this product, used it correctly and voila - the cd player worked perfectly.  All the problems cleared up.  Now, whenever it starts to skip I know it is from dust or something in the player and it just needs a simple clean.Bottom line, this product is inexpensive and it works to perfection.  I have had it 4 years and it is still going strong.  I highly recommend this product.  Finally, something that actually does what it says it does.",5

My console pretty much stopped reading discs. I would have to eject a disc, and put it back in at least 10 times before it would read it. I ordered this based on the reviews. I figured that it may not read the cleaner disc right away, since it didn't read my games. So I put it in, it would spin up, and then would say no disc. This only happened once! The next time I ran it, it read the disc! To be safe, I ran the disc 3 times. I put in a game it would not read, and it read it on the first try! I highly recommend this product.",5

B00000J1QK,Allsop CD Laser-Lens Cleaner,A3MMVTD7DA3PJ8,A CD savior,"My car's 6 CD changer was intermittently losing and skipping sound in the left channel.  Because the right channel remained OK I did not think it might be a dirt or cleaning issue.  I figured both left and right channels should be affected.  I lamented over my player for weeks because I could ill-afford whatever the cost might have been to even have a tech check out a fancy Bose CD player embedded in the dashboard of a car.  I gradually listened to my player less and less because knowing the sound problem just made me more sensitive to the imperfections when they occurred. Finally I figured, what have I got to lose just to find out if this is a ""dirt"" problem?  $8 bucks compared to all other alternatives was a small price to pay. Hola macarola...I'll be darned if this disc didn't cure my player immediately! I wish I had given this thing a shot a lot sooner.  Technically there was problem though.  The instructions say the CD has sound.  It's supposed to alert you when it's done cleaning or whatever.  My product produced no sound at any time.  I inserted it into my player and my dash display simply blinked indicating a playing disc. It ran, and ran, and ran.  It never alerted me in any way that the process was over nor did it stop running on its own.  I simply had to eject it. I deducted one star only because of this ""technicality"".",4

This cleaner, used one time, fixed the problem.  Problem hasn't occurred again, in more than a year.I was hesitant to try it....some reviews and advice said it could ruin the system.

So, if the problems you are experiencing are the result of dirt or dust this is a simple and effective solution. But, don't expect it to cure mechanical or other problems. If your CD drive is giving you problems, this is worth a try. If it doesn't work you are not out much and you know the problem isn't dirt on the lens.

B00000J1QR,Allsop CD and DVD FastWipes,A33GQ5EG104KN7,Seems To Work Fine,I have a Netflix subscription and receive DVDs in the mail. There are a high number of these discs that have scratches and smudges on them. Rather than send it back because it won't play correctly I give them a quick wipe with these cloths and have had success with almost every DVD.,4
B00000J1QR,Allsop CD and DVD FastWipes,A10QQWAYZVX2QS,DVD Wipes,There is really not much you can say about a clean wipe. The product does clean fingerprints on the DVD. I'm very satisfied with the product. If it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better.,4
B00000J1QR,Allsop CD and DVD FastWipes,A2SPHO9F2ZL98F,Good but not Excellent wipes,These CD or DVD wipes are good for removing surface lint or smudges on Disks but dont expect them to remove serious glitches or hang ups. They are dry thats the first hing so they cant really be expected to remove any ingrained glitches but cetainly for the maintenance of disks and keeping them dust free these are very good. I was looking for somthing that would really help to illiminate some hang ups and getting stuck type glitches that I had so in fact I ended up just buying a new DVD of the same recording...but its a good product for maintenance. I guess the lesson I learnt is not to leave the disk in the player when not being used. Also the method to wipe off a disk is so important not to use a circular motion say like you would on an old LP recording..so I did in fact also learn something from the instructions as well.,4
B00000J1QR,Allsop CD and DVD FastWipes,A2CGLPWEC9NL0E,Not what I wanted.,You can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk.  It did not remove the scratches from my disk.  Waste of money.,2
B00000J1QR,Allsop CD and DVD FastWipes,A41I67QYRAOSQ,Works Very Well,"Pretty simple product.  There are about 30 or so sheets in a package. Take one out and wipe in a circular motion.

I ordered these wipe to clean the discs without risks of scratching them...so I was totally horrified by this information. I currently use a lens cleaning cloth for glasses from my optician. No problem with scratches but more expensive.I RETURNED this product because I was afraid as the package warns that I could scratch my discs.

B00000J1QR,Allsop CD and DVD FastWipes,A29UNXK7F3S93L,Amazingly good,"I just bought my second pack of these wipes. I bought the first pack late last year and am finally running out of them. I was totally surprised that these wipes work so well. I have had DVD's that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface. Taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge (across the grooves) seems to get the job done. Today, my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a DVD he handed to me. When I put it in the player it skipped and then stopped. I pulled it out and saw the crud. I used a fresh wiper and Voila!! the DVD played without a hitch. I know I am probably not supposed to do this, but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a DVD and I use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two. I haven't seen a downside. I truly think they are amazing.",5
B00000J1QR,Allsop CD and DVD FastWipes,A19JDXB5R33C7R,A better CD/DVD cleaner than my T-shirts ... :-),"I have small children who often put fingerprints on our kiddie DVDs.  Typically, I clean them by ""breathing"" on the dirty DVD and using the inside of my T-shirt to wipe clean these DVDs.  However, I began to look for another solution that didn't involve my T-shirt.  This product ... the Allsop CD and DVD fast-wipes looked like a possible solution, so I ordered a pack.After giving them a try, I find they work well ... they don't get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help (or in my case, a ""breath"" on the DVD), but they get about 95 percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily.  The material is lint free and works as advertised.  20 CD/DVD shaped wipes come per pack.  Being shaped like a DVD is just a gimmick.  I usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping, so if they were square-shaped (and thus had a little more material) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle.  The instructions say that each wipe can be re-used until it becomes visably dirty or worn, so you can clean multiple DVDs per wipe.Overall, these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price.  Four stars.",4

B00000J1SC,Belkin 8’’ Cable Ties (6-Pack),A4OGL6HINEZVL,There are better choices,"As others have noted, there is only a small amount of velcro to hold.Also, I like the type of ties that you can wrap first around the cable (so you don't lose the tie) and then around the bundle.With the way these work, you can't do that.If you want ties in different colors and you won't be using them much (e.g. wrapping up a cable and storing it in a drawer until you need it) then these might be ok..but for the road warrior trying to keep all his cables organized, pick something else.",2

What I have found, is that if I just tie something up and leave the cable types alone, these work great.I am happy with them.",4

The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.",5
B00000J1SC,Belkin 8’’ Cable Ties (6-Pack),A1PGUHJ9ZN499P,Keeps cords organized but design is missing key feature,"These straps are great for the general purpose of organizing entertainment center cords,  computer system cords... Etc.  My intended use for these straps was to manage cords for medical equipment during travel.  The worn straps these were to replace looped onto a cord before wrapping allowing it to stay in place when the cords are released.  Unfortunately,  these are missing that same basic design feature making them more likely to get lost as you need to secure it everytime you release the cord,  whereas other velcro straps remain secure at all times.  Not a big deal if you just want to organize cords of stationary electronics,  but then again for that purpose you may as well save a few dollars and buy a bag of classic zip ties.",3

Just know they won't work well on smaller applications.,"This is a great set of reusable color codes cable ties for medium to large wires. They are a bit to big for smaller wires and you need to get at least a thumb full of wire to secure them properly(Picture sizing out Spagetti for two people big). If you need it for a few small wires it won't work as well. These are also a bit hard to use inside a computer case because of the excess material. I see the appication for these more like using them to bind togther cords from a home entertainment system, or the mess of cords coming from the back of the computer.",4

They are mostly loop, and towards the end there is a 1"" piece of loop sewn on.  I found this to be rather stiff and didn't readily bend to conform to the cables I was wrapping.  8"" is a nice length, but much longer than what I needed, so I ended up wrapping around a few times before trying to close it.  You could probably cut an end off, but I like longer ties, as it seems I'm constantly moving things around and I get very frustrated when I find something a few inches short.

In that aspect these little things are great!There isn't much to say about a cable tie, but for that extra nudge to get free shipping, these are a must!Pros-inexpensive bump to get free shipping-velcro, and multi colored-no more crazy wires!Cons-tag fell off of one, but for under 3 bucks, not that big a deal-too short for anything other than cables, again not a real con but it would be great to see a similar product with more length.I bought 3 packs of these so far and as long as I still have cables, I will slowly get more with each Amazon purchase :)",5
B00000J1SC,Belkin 8’’ Cable Ties (6-Pack),A38D9RSMAYZSCM,Poorly thought out design,"I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past.  The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with  a slot in the top, so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped.  These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie.  You have to wrap it carefully (and not particularly tightly) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks.  If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off.  These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described.  One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you aren't going to be undoing them regularly.  True, but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost.",2

Otherwise I just wrap one end around the cable and staple the two ends together, and now it's ""permanently"" tethered to one end.I guess the only other downside might be that the option to purchase a single colour was not available. What if you want to have only one colour for your cables, so that they don't end up being in your partner's case?  And I suppose the colours could've been brighter.But they do look nice, and there's plenty of length to handle just about any normal length of cable being wrapped up.",4

B00000J1SC,Belkin 8’’ Cable Ties (6-Pack),A1YSTRGTX7B66G,I like these things,"I've used these velcro straps, and similar velcro straps from other manufacturers, for several years now to secure cables for computer systems, networking systems, and entertainment systems in my home.  Before I discovered the velcro cable ties, I was using the plastic cable ties where you feed one end through a hole in the other end, pull until tight, and cut off the ""tail"".  But the thing I didn't like about the plastic cable ties is they can't be re-used and you have to cut them to remove them.  That's not a problem if you rarely mess with your equipment and cables, but in my case I seem to be upgrading something, moving something, repairing something, or throwing something away on a regular basis.  That meant I was regularly cutting a bunch of plastic cable ties, getting new ones, and re-tieing everything, which I sort of began to dread and then loath.  The velcro cable ties make it alot easier.There's is a somewhat peculiar skill involved in learning how to wrap these things around a bundle of cables and getting them tight, but once you figure it out, it's very simple and you can get them very tight if you want.  I've never had one come lose on its own, so they're also very reliable.  Basically I'd recommend this type of cable tie to anyone, and this particular product from Belkin has worked well for me.",5

I'm a guitarist and constantly having to wrap up chords and wires is annoying, especially when I try to take them out again only to find them a tangled mess! Ties are a perfect solution to this problem.  I wrap them up and stack them, then when I use them again they're still nicely placed.They look exactly as they do in the picture and function as well as you would think.  They are velcro and they hold very well.  I've had no problems with them yet.  I have been using them heavily (taking them off and putting them back on again) for months and haven't noticed much wear at all.  Sometimes the soft side of velcro frays and becomes useless over time but I have noticed almost none of this with the Belkin product.My only complaint would be that they are a little pricey for something that just holds stuff together but you definitely get what you pay for.",5

Ironically the cable is in the other room connected to a printer and still transmitting flawlessly. The moral is this is one well constructed cable and has returned my investment many times over.The connectors still mate and disengage smoothly like the first day I used it, and I am pretty sure that the beefy strain reliefs on each end are responsible for keeping the conductors inside the thick insulator intact. Indeed, as I inspected this cable before writing this review I marveled at the construction and materials. Both are first rate.This cable has traveled extensively - it was part of my travel kit when I was a road warrior consultant, and served me well in many US states as well as the Middle East on long and short assignments. Back to the strain reliefs: I would hastily pack and literally ball this cable up and throw it in my laptop case, yet the ends never damaged, which I attribute - in part - to the strain reliefs that kept crimps from breaking or fraying the conductors.Bottom line - this model is now USB 2.0 compatible and is built to last.

B00000J1UQ,Belkin 6 Feet Replacement Power Cord,A6FIAB28IS79,Power to the people,"When, after moving a treadmill, I couldn't find the power cord, my first efforts were devoted to locating the manufacturer's website, phone number, mailing address, all the while wringing my hands in despair that my costly, indispensable machine had been rendered worthless due to the loss of a mere power cord, which certainly had to be custom-made to fit the opening designed for it by the makers of this aristocratic device (30 years ago I viewed all owners of treadmills as self-indulgent elitists).  But while waiting for a company representative to answer one of my phone calls, it suddenly occurred to me that my father had once purchased a power cord for an old TV set at a hardware store, and with no regard even toward the make of TV.So I looked on Amazon, instantly found something that looked promising (the description ""Universal"" was admittedly encouraging), and in two days both the treadmill and I were back up and running.  The pedestrian exchange (in both senses of the word) would no doubt have proven satisfying to anyone of any age, generation, class, ethnicity or gender, amounting to no less than the discovery of one's autonomy in a world of high-priced experts and ""gotcha"" specialists.  Moreover, how reassuring it is whenever one discovers and comes into possession of the knowledge that previously had no doubt belonged to everyone but your own isolated, ""out-of-the-loop,"" lonely self.  I hesitate to say whether the cord was more empowering to me or the treadmill.  But don't be shocked if the product delivers what it promises--twice over.[Since writing the above, I've discovered a company (Essential Sounds Products, Inc.) claiming its power cord is ""Amazing,"" ""Innovative,"" ""Revolutionary""--that after using it to supply power to, for example, an amplifier, the cord's owner will settle for nothing less (""One listen, and nothing else will do"").  This possibility sort of blows my tribute to the universality of the common power cord, but I remain to be sold on the new, revolutionary product.  If it converts my television set to ""Smell-o-vision"" (for those of you old enough to remember) or my kitchen toaster to a turbo-charged forge suitable for alchemy experiments, I'll be persuaded.  Return for updates.][Argh. The ESP (the acronym for the manufacturer) power cord begins at well over a hundred and the power strip at five hundred.  I smell exploitation of musicians (and gearheads) who, like athletes, are sometimes willing to try anything for that winning edge. Better to buy this Belkin and, if it bothers you, paint it some other color and put an exorbitant price tag on it so people will think it's one of those elitist A.C. cords.]",5

Literally,"I bought this exact same cable in the 25 foot length a couple years ago and was very pleased with it, and needed a longer length for my new setup.  So I went to look for a 50 foot length of the same brand, same model (as it were).  Found it (this one).  Ordered it.  Received it.  Opened it.And then it hit me.  THE STENCH!  The cable I got REEKED of chemical, plasticy, rubbery odor that was HIGHLY unpleasant.  This wasn't the case with my 25 foot cable!  Perhaps they cheaped out on the jacket?  Or just simply changed suppliers?  I have no idea.  But, if you have a sense of smell at all, avoid this cable.  I ended up buying a Dynex 50' cat 5e ethernet cable from Best Buy for too much money.  What can I say, I needed it right then.  Something very similar is sold on Amazon for a lot less, but it doesn't look exactly the same (although it probably is).  If it IS the same, then I can tell you that the Dynex cable does not smell at all and is a very nice and flexible cable which feels like it has some kind of high quality jacket material.Buyer beware.",1

B00000J1V5,Belkin 7-Feet CAT5e Snagless Patch Cable (Gray),A14JBDSWKPKTZA,"Great cable, the snagless feature saves the cord","These Belkin category 5e cables are well made. They are a good overall gauge thickness and the snag less ends are very beneficial. You may have experienced the problem of untangling a phone cord, only to have the clip on the end bend over or worse yet snap off. The next time you use that cord it doesn't have anything to keep it in the wall. Well what Belkin did with these snag less cables was put twin ridges made out of a rubbery plastic, that puts the snap in clip in a valley down below the ridges. So if you are untangling, those ridges prevent other wires from snagging the clip. That is a great idea. That is not enough to make you want to buy the cable, if it weren't for the fact that it is overall a great cable. The seven-foot length is good for a small patch area, like when connecting your modem to a router, or when your cable or DSL modem and/or router are right next to your computer.The other nice thing is the price here at Amazon on these cables. I went into the local nationally famous office supply, and they were half again as much money. So overall it is a very nice combination. They also don't slow down your connection at all. I get the same exact connection speed when using the online speed tests when I use the 50-foot, or the 7-foot.Highly recommended. Buy it here at Amazon and save the money.",5

It's a good price, and I like being able to get various colors because it helps with cable management.  But this cable had a different sort of plastic sheath on the connector head than I am used to and I do not like that at all.  In order to press the plastic release for the connector, you have to fit your finger between two raised edges.  Clearly this is to protect the release from the common breakage problem, and I appreciate the attempt...but this was too hard to use: couldn't release it with my thumb, had to use my index finger.  Plus you can't do it from the side, you have to have your finger at the correct angle, which can be a problem when you're under a desk with your hand snaked around behind your router or what have you.",4

But my 7 footers, shown on Amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop, all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every 3 1/2 to 4 1/5 inches along the entire length, and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie. Each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket. Cables don't like sharp bends (mine have 17 tight bends along a 7' cable), those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces, they make a rat's nest behind my comm gear, and they jeopardize the integrity of the cable.C'mon Belkin, your ""Pro Series"" packaging is a silly gimmick, because at a thrifty $2.50 per cable, I'm betting dollars to donuts there's nothing special about your cables, no rare metals, no exotic coatings, no braided stainless shielding... it's a generic Ethernet cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Kindly treat it as such. Treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packaging.Meanwhile, my 15' cables from Mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box, in a neat 5"" diameter coil. No kinks, no sharp bends. I try to order from Mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box, no fancy packaging, no rocket science, no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks, just a sound cable. Unfortunately, they did not have 7-footers when I needed them. So I went with Belkin, after all it's just a cable. Next time I'll wait for Mediabridge to re-stock.",3
