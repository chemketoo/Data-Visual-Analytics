<h3>About our Dataset</h3>
<p>Our web app allows users to evaluate and analyze the sentiment of product reviews. We have used a static electronics product reviews dataset compiled by Julian McCauley of UCSD and Stanford University. This dataset has over a million reviews and is around 1.5 gigabytes in size. It covers a diverse range of electronics offered from different manufacturers and related information. The raw unprocessed dataset can be found at this URL: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html.</br> </br>

(Note: When viewing our visualizations please allow a few seconds for it to render)</p>
